<h3 id="biopsychosocial-approach-to-care">Biopsychosocial Approach to Care<a class="headerlink" href="#biopsychosocial-approach-to-care" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The term <em>biopsychosocial</em> indicate an approach to health service delivery that <strong>addresses the psychological and social aspects of health and treatment</strong>, that includes behavioral and environmental issues. Intervention that considers biopsychosocial issues related to health requires the use of a <strong>transdisciplinary team</strong> of professionals to address medical problems and concerns in a variety of settings. Note that besides all medical specialities, nurses, pharmacists, social works, administrators, therapists, and health aids, family members are also increasingly recognized as part of a multidisciplinary team.</p>
<p>Evidence in support of biopsychosocial approach to care
-   Among people with cardiovascular disease, untreated depression has been found to increase the risk of a heart attack (Monster, 2004)
-   After a major medical procedure, such as open heart surgery, a patient's anxiety may increase (Ben-Zur, 2000)
-   A person who is depressed may be less motivated to f/u with medical appointments, and cope poorly with his diagnosis and treatment regimens, further adversely impacting his physical health (Livneh, 2000)
-   Effective coping, enhanced self-efficacy, and optimism have been associated with enhanced quality of life in people with chronic illnesses (Rose, 2002)</p>

<p>Five factors have led emergency physicians to develop a unique approach to the patient: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the pressure of time and volume </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>must be prepared to “treat first and ask questions later.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of triage decisions everyday</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the variety of conditions faced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the paucity of information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the limitation of therapeutic options: can provide only temporizing or symptomatic treatment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the constraint of disposition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ED ultimately reduces to three binary decisions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Is the patient sick or not sick? </li>
<li>If sick, should I treat or not treat? </li>
<li>Should I admit or discharge? </li>

<h3 id="triage">Triage<a class="headerlink" href="#triage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Dominique Jean-Larry; Started triage and camel ambulance</p>
<p>Triage involves the sorting of patients based on the resources required for treatment and the resources that are actually available. </p>
<ul>
<li>The order of treatment is based on the ABC priorities (airway with cervical spine protection, breathing, and circulation with hemorrhage control). </li>
<li>Other factors that can affect triage and treatment priority include the severity of injury, ability to survive, and available resources. </li>
<li>Triage also includes the sorting of patients in the field to help determine the appropriate receiving medical facility. Trauma team activation may be considered for severely injured patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prehospital personnel and their medical directors are responsible for ensuring that appropriate patients arrive at appropriate hospitals.</p>
<p>Triage situations are categorised as multiple casualties or mass casualties</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple casualties: number of patients and the severity of their injuries <em>do not</em> exceed the capability of the facility to render care</li>
<li>Patients with life-threatening problems and those sustaining multiple-system injuries are treated first.</li>
<li>Mass casualties: number of patients and the severity of their injuries <em>does</em> exceed the capability of the facility and staff</li>
<li>Patients having the greatest chance of survival and requiring the least expenditure of time, equipment, supplies, and personnel are treated first</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ed-triage-in-singapore">ED Triage in Singapore<a class="headerlink" href="#ed-triage-in-singapore" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>We recognise that for practical purposes most EDs tend to have four different acuity-type patient care areas, viz :-</p>
<ol>
<li>Resuscitation Area</li>
<li>Non-Resuscitation Major Emergency (Critical) Area</li>
<li>Minor Emergency (Ambulant) Area</li>
<li>Non-Emergency Area</li>
</ol>
<p>It is also well recognised that the greater the number of triage categories present, the more difficult it is for triage nurses to accurately reflect the correct triage value. Sometimes, a more accurate acuity categorisation is done at the end of the patient visit by the Emergency Department doctor who attended to the patient.</p>
<p>In Emergency medicine, the work-up and intensity of initial investigations and management often depends on the presenting complaint, rather than on the final diagnosis. Waiting time, resource utilisation and process times would therefore tend to mirror more the presenting complaint than the final diagnosis. The A&amp;E Services, MOH has therefore agreed that patient acuity criteria be based on a combination of initial complaints and initial provisional diagnoses. There will be four patient acuity classes for all public Emergency Departments.</p>
<p>Triage is a dynamic process, we might have to up-triage or down triage after some time.</p>

<h3 id="chronic-diseases">Chronic Diseases<a class="headerlink" href="#chronic-diseases" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Chronic diseases can be categorized according to
-   Four key dimensions that have an impact on the family system (Rolland (1994)):
    1.  onset - family adapt differently when the onset is rapid vs. gradual
    2.  course - progressive, constant, improves over time, or fluctuating
    3.  outcome - fatal OR lifespan reduction but nonfatal; nonfatal conditions do not have neither a predictable timeline of demise nor a strong likelihood that they will emerge as the principal cause of death; fatal disease require more direct confrontation with high likelihood of death, calling for particular adaptive demands by the affected individual and the family system that are a part of the death and dying process.
    4.  degree of incapacitation
-   Distinct psychosocial typologies, each with its own set of implications for the adaptation and social functioning of the family system. These depend on the interaction between the 4 dimensions of a disease</p>
<p>Domains of Impact of Chronic Disease on Family</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chronic disease affects the family system's instrumental functions as a social unit to meet</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Economic needs</p>
</li>

<p>Developmental and emotional needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical needs - primary care and support system for ill and disabled</p>

<p>Microorganisms are spread primarily through three ways within a hospital setting</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Airborne</strong>: occurs when infectious pathogens are aerosolized and remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. e.g. <strong>TB, chickenpox, measles</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Droplet</strong>: occurs when droplets containing microorganisms from the infected person are propelled a short distance through the air and deposited on the susceptible host's conjunctivae, nasal mucosa, or mouth. E.g. <strong>respiratory tract infections, influenza, MRSA respiratory disperser, mumps, rubella, Neisseria Meningitis</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contact</strong>: there are two forms of contact transmission</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct transmission: involves physical contract between an infected person and a susceptible person</li>
<li>Indirect transmission: involves contact of a susceptible person with a contaminated intermediate object
Examples: <strong>MRSA, VRE, clostridium difficle</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="clinical-reasoning">Clinical Reasoning<a class="headerlink" href="#clinical-reasoning" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><em>Clinical reasoning is the process, by which a health care provider takes objective data, acquired from an actual patient, and interprets it from factual knowledge from a textbook or the medical literature in order to either make a diagnosis or develop a treatment plan.</em> </p>
<p>It isn't a single skill but rather a collection of related skills including</p>
<ul>
<li>Interpretation of subjective data</li>
<li>Evaluation of the accuracy and validity of data</li>
<li>Synthesis of individual pieces of data into higher order groups</li>
<li>Determination of the relevance of scientific literature for a specific clinical situation</li>

<h3 id="generating-a-differential-diagnosis">Generating a Differential Diagnosis<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-a-differential-diagnosis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A differential diagnosis is a list of possible diagnosis which may explain the patient's presentation. It should</p>
<ul>
<li>Include those diagnoses in which either the likelihood is high enough or the danger, if it should be missed is high enough, in order to warrant additional testing to investigate that specific diagnosis.</li>
<li>It may include additional diagnoses whose likelihood is low enough to not warrant immediate testing, but which have not been completely ruled out</li>
<li>It is prioritized in descending order of likelihood.</li>
<li>Unlike a framework / approach, <em>the differential diagnosis is specific to the patient while the framework (or approach) is not</em></li>
<li>Note atypical presentations!</li>
</ul>
<p>A solid focused differential diagnosis should include</p>
<ul>
<li>The one diagnosis that you believe to be the most likely - the \"working diagnosis\", or \"provisional diagnosis\"</li>
<li>2 - 4 diagnosis that are very common in general, for which this patient case could be either a typical or an atypical presentation</li>
<li>Any diagnoses which are rapidly fatal if untreated, of which this patient case could plausibly be a result - a \"don't miss diagnosis\"</li>
<li>Any diagnoses which are specifically suggested by standout features of the patient's history - most of these will turn out to be \"red herrings\"</li>
</ul>
<p>Generating a list of differentials consists of 5 steps as outlined in the following subsections.</p>
<h4 id="acquire-data">Acquire Data<a class="headerlink" href="#acquire-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sources can include: Previous charts, Hx, PE, Tests, Talking to family and friends for collateral information etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More mature clinicians can dynamically identifying differential diagnosis as data collection is going on; this helps them select the necessary lab tests. However it does not always result in a more accurate diagnosis. In particular, such a process can set one up for <strong>Anchoring Bias</strong>. <em>This is the tendency to place too much weight on a single piece of information acquired early in the data acquisition process, and a failure to update the differential diagnosis when conflicting information is later presented.</em> Be aware of this bias, once all data is acquired, force myself to return to the beginning of the clinical reasoning process so that each piece of data is given equal weight.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="identify-key-features">Identify Key Features<a class="headerlink" href="#identify-key-features" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Key features are individual elements of the presentation which are likely to help differentiate one diagnosis from another.</p>

<p>This is a 1 - 2 sentence summary, using precise medical terminology, of the most highly relevant aspects of the patient's history, exam, and diagnostic tests.\
\
Now consider using the following structure for the problem representation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Age and gender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highly relevant PMH</p>
<ul>
<li>multiple cardiovascular risk factors: HTN, diabetes, obesity, smoking</li>
<li>multiple psychosocial stressors</li>

<li>40 pack year smoking history</li>
<li>previously healthy</li>
<li>significant sun exposure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary symptom using semantic qualifiers\
    Semantic qualifiers are qualitative abstraction of the signs and symptoms of a case in which an opposing abstraction is either explicit or implied. These help to reframe a patient's symptom into terms more familiar to the clinician and easier to communicate to others. Common categories of qualifiers include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Onset</strong>: abrupt or progressive</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: acute or chronic</li>
<li><strong>Course</strong>: continuous or episodic</li>
<li><strong>Site</strong>: unilateral or bilateral, proximal or distal, diffuse or localized</li>
<li><strong>Symptom trigger</strong>: Post-prandial, exertional, pleuritic, or positional</li>
<li><strong>Presence of pain</strong>: painful or painless</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that some information is lost when patient's presentation is translated into semantic qualifiers, which can set one up for bias if the original history is never revisited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summarize highly relevant diagnostic data, especially the ones directly relevant to the chief complain. Synthesize constellation of clearly related findings into a single clinical syndrome when possible</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hemodynamically stable</strong>: unremarkable vitals</li>
<li><strong>Without evidence of acute infarction</strong>: lack of Q waves or lack of ST segment elevation, normal cardiac enzymes.</li>
<li><strong>SIRS</strong>: elevated WBC, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea</li>
<li><strong>ARDS</strong>: acute onset dyspnea, bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary edema detected on CT or CXR, PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 300 mmHg</li>
<li><strong>Peritoneal signs</strong>: soft abdomen and lack of rebound tenderness</li>
<li><strong>Hepatic failure</strong>: </li>
<li><strong>Volume overload</strong>: peripheral edema, dyspnea, abdominal distention, fatigue, and lassitude</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't mis-interpret the clinical syndrome for the diagnosis! e.g. sepsis is not a diagnosis, find the cause of the sepsis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples of representation:</p>

<p>A 54 year male without health concerns or known medical problem presents for routine physical examination after not engaging with regular healthcare for over a decade. He is overweight and his blood pressure is elevated today, but the remainder of his physical exam is unremarkable. He has some cardiovascular risk factors including physical inactivity due to his work as a taxi driver, regular intake of fast food, and mother with hypercholesteronemia. His father had a MI at age 64, though this does not conferr significant risk to this patient, and he has some financial stressors and does not have health insurance.</p>

<p>Sarah is a 24-year-old female with a family history of migraines who presents complaining of two types of chronic, progressively worsening headaches. The first type are severe, throbbing, and unilateral with associated nausea, photophobia, and hyperacusis, last all day when present, occur one- to two- times weekly, are worse prior to menses, and do not improve with ibuprofen. The second type are mild-to-moderate and bilateral, last all day most days, and have associated neck discomfort. On exam Sarah is afebrile with normal vital signs, has a mildly tender occiput, and has no focal neurologic defects, signs of increased intracranial pressure, or meningeal irritation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Andrew is a sexually active 17-year-old male who presents with a four-hour history of severe right groin pain with radiation to the right scrotum and associated nausea but no vomiting, fever, or urinary symptom. The patient reports a similar episode six to nine months ago that resolved spontaneously. Physical exam finds a swollen, erythematous right scrotum with an exquisitely tender right testicle, no masses, a negative Prehn sign, an absent cremasteric reflex on the right, absent blue dot sign, and no transillumination of the scrotum. iMr. Barley is a 58-year-old male smoker who presents with a two-week history of productive cough and dyspnea on exertion. He has had similar symptoms during the past two winters. He denies fever, chest pain, epigastric pain, symptoms of CHF, recent travel, or TB or chemical exposures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Marshall is a 72-year-old man, with a history of hypertension, COPD and moderate dementia, who presents with 4 days of increased confusion, nighttime restlessness, visual hallucinations, and urinary incontinence. His physical exam is unremarkable except for tachypnea, a mildly enlarged prostate, inattentiveness, and a worsening of his MMSE score from a baseline of 18 to 12 today.</p>

<h3 id="obtaining-sexual-history">Obtaining Sexual History<a class="headerlink" href="#obtaining-sexual-history" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It is necessary to ask very personal questions when taking a sexual history. It is wise to warn the patient that you are going to ask these questions and to explain why they are necessary.
The prime consideration for patients is CONFIDENTIALITY and the reluctant patient may be more forthcoming when reassured of this by the physician. Moralistic attitudes should never be adopted, except perhaps towards the “repeater” or “defaulter” who continually puts both his/her own health and the health of others at risk.
Questions should also be phrased in a language that the patient will understand i.e. non- technical, and terms may need to be phrased in “street language”.</p>
<p>We ask questions to find out –
- risk of exposure to certain infections
- sites of exposure to infection (so we know where to take samples from)
- contact tracing – is it possible to contact the sexual contacts to advise them to
seek tests and treatment</p>
<p>Golden rules for taking a sexual history –
- assume nothing
- demonstrate that you have heard it all before
- never look shocked or surprised
- do not appear judgemental</p>
<p>Difficulty is often encountered in establishing the patient’s sexual orientation. It is naive to assume that a married man, perhaps with children, would not have indulged in homosexual activity. Unambiguous direct questioning is often necessary, again followed by further explanation if needed. Indeed all physicians should be aware of the spectrum of human sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient merely to ask whether the patient has noticed any “troubles” or “symptoms”. A negative reply may be an important “negative” and should be substantiated by a properly taken history.</p>
<p>When syphilis or other systemic infections are suspected, the history must be more comprehensive and direct questions asked about each system.</p>
<p>Take the opportunity to do some health promotion. The majority of patients know very little about STIs/HIV.</p>

    - (If long-standing) is it related to periods?</p>
<p>Urinary Symptoms
- Have you noticed any burning sensation passing water? As for males, but if “yes”
- Do you think the burning is caused by the urine coming out, or by urine coming into contact with inflammation on the outside? (external or vulval dysuria)
- Also enquire about urgency, loin pains, fever and rigors. (Suggestive of pyelonephritis secondary to urinary infections)</p>
<p>Genital Lesions
- Have you noticed any sores, spots or irritation in your genital area? Details as for males</p>
<p>Menstrual History
- What was the date of the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP)?
- Was this period “normal” for you? If not, was it heavier (menorrhagia)? Lighter (oligomenorrhoea)?
Record details of preceding period (s) as indicated
- Have you noticed any bleeding after intercourse (post-coital bleeding – PCB) or
any bleeding in between your periods (intermenstrual bleeding IMB)?</p>
<p>Gynaecological and Obstetric History
- Are you or your partner using any form of contraception? Eg oral contraceptive (OC), intrauterine device (IUD), diaphragm, sheath, pessaries, “rhythm” method etc.
    - If a barrier method is employed – is it always, usually or occasionally used?
    - If taking OC have any pills been missed?
- Have you ever been pregnant?
If “yes” record details – can use GxPx format
Patients may sometimes misunderstand the question to mean how many children they have. It is important to ask for number of pregnancies and number of live births. This may reveal a past history of failed pregnancy such as termination of pregnancy, spontaneous abortion or ectopic pregnancy.
- Have you had any tummy pains recently other than you would expect with your periods?
- Do you suffer from pain on intercourse?
If “yes” record type (superficial or deep), frequency (always or occasionally), duration (eg 1 week, 3 months or always)
- Have you had any gynaecological problems in the past?
(Eg Laparoscopy for suspected ectopic pregnancy 2 years ago)
- Have you had a (cancer) pap smear test before? If yes, when was the most recent one, and what was the result
- Have you had vaccination against the human papilloma virus (Cervarix / Gardasil)?</p>

<p>There are two essentials – first privacy for the patient, and secondly a good source of light for the doctor.</p>
<p>It is rarely practicable to perform a full physical examination on all patients, but in certain circumstances, such as when <strong>Syphilis, Reiter’s disease, disseminated gonococcal infection or HIV infection</strong> is suspected a thorough general examination is indicated.</p>
<p>In all cases, however, a meticulous examination of the genitalia and anal region should be performed. However, it takes very little additional time to inspect the skin and mucous membranes (eyes and mouth) and to check for the presence of generalized lymphadenopathy.</p>
<h4 id="genital-examination-in-males">Genital Examination in Males<a class="headerlink" href="#genital-examination-in-males" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The genitalia should be fully exposed with both trousers and underpants fully dropped or preferably removed.</p>
<p>First inspect the inguinal region and then palpate it for evidence of lymphadenopathy - the distribution, consistency and tenderness of any nodes should be noted. At the same time closely inspect the pubic area and surrounding exposed skin for evidence of pediculosis, folliculitis or other skin lesions.</p>
<p>Next palpate the spermatic cord on both sides between the thumb and index finger. Although it may be difficult to discern the individual components, take note of any undue tenderness, thickening or asymmetry. The vas deferens may readily be palpated separately, but in patients who have had a vasectomy, ill-defined nodular thickening may be apparent.</p>
<p>The scrotum should then be inspected for asymmetry, erythema and superficial lesions (eg scrotal cysts, varicocoele) and the scrotal contents palpated (carefully!) for abnormality of the testis or epididymis. Slight variation in testicular size is common, but if marked variation is apparent, enquiry into past trauma, surgery or infection (eg mumps orchitis) may provide the reason for such discrepancy. If the scrotal contents seem enlarged and are difficult to discern on palpation transillumination may support the diagnosis of a hydrocoele.</p>
<p>Finally, attention should be directed to the penis itself, which first should be inspected from base to tip noting any abnormalities. The patient should then be asked to retract his foreskin (if present) as far back as it will go, and the subpreputial area inspected for evidence of balanitis, posthitis or any other abnormality. Special care should be taken that the entire circumference of the coronal sulcus is visualized. In patients with phimosis, especially of recent onset, careful palpation may reveal tenderness or induration under the foreskin.</p>
<p>While the foreskin is retracted inspect the external urinary meatus for evidence of meatitis, urethra should be “milked” gently by the examiner or patient. Examination of the inside of the front of the underpants may also provide evidence supportive of a urethral discharge.</p>
<p>The perianal region should also be examined (the patient is asked to bend over forwards and separate his buttocks), especially when there is a genital fungal infection or warts. These conditions often spread to this area and may be asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Both perianal and proctoscopic examination are essential in passive homosexuals. Proctoscopy may be performed in either the left lateral or knee-elbow position.</p>
<h4 id="genital-examination-in-females">Genital Examination in Females<a class="headerlink" href="#genital-examination-in-females" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>This is most easily performed with the patient in the lithotomy position.</p>
<p>Understandably, many women find this position and the genital examination embarrassing and uncomfortable. Moreover, time spent waiting in a half-undressed state increases anxiety, which makes the examination more difficult and time-consuming.</p>
<p>The inguinal region and surrounding area should first be examined first as in the male, and then attention focused on the external genitalia and introitus. Wipe off any discharge with cotton wool, and gently separate first the labia majora and then the labia minora to exclude any labial erythema, oedema, fissuring or vulval lesions. At the same time palpate to assess any enlargement of Bartholin’s glands, and inspect their ducts for evidence of discharge. The buttocks should then be separated for inspection of the perianal region.</p>
<p>Next, after forewarning the patient, introduce a bivalve speculum (warmed under the tap if necessary). After passing of the speculum, visualize the cervix first and then take a sample for the appropriate test.</p>
<p>The appearance of the cervical epithelium, any abnormality and the presence or absence of any cervical exudates (eg purulent, mucopurulent, clear) should be recorded, as should the presence of the IUD thread. Withdraw the speculum carefully and inspect the walls of the vagina (cleaned with cotton wool if necessary) for lesions.</p>
<p>The urethra is best examined after removal of the speculum. Urethral tests are taken at the same time, and particular note should be made of any discharge.</p>
<p>Finally, a bimanual examination should be done, both to assess the size of the uterus and to detect the presence of any abnormalities in the adnexae. Rocking of the cervix (“cervical excitation”) is a useful test in the diagnosis of salpingitis.</p>

The physician's responsibility is to the patient, and ethically the physician must adhere to the patient's wishes as outlined in the living will. The <strong>living will protects</strong> the patient's <strong>autonomy</strong> and <strong>overrules</strong> the wishes of any <strong>family members</strong>.</p>
<p>If there is no advanced medical directive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiating a family meeting if the family members disagreed about the course of action and there was no living will and/or no designated health care proxy in place.</li>

<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act protects health information by requiring <strong>verbal or written authorization</strong> for release of information. Hospitals and physicians' offices frequently have additional policies requiring written forms for release of information and procedures to verify the identity of phone callers. It is important that health care providers be familiar with these rules and <strong>disclose only the minimum necessary information</strong>, which is a central aspect of the HIPAA privacy rule.</p>
<p>Confidential patient information should be disclosed only to fellow health care workers who are directly involved in the patient's care. Physicians should avoid discussing a patient's medical condition in public areas where comments might be overheard. Inappropriate inquiries from colleagues curious about a patient's medical condition should be politely but firmly rebuffed.</p>
<p>Do not suggest that information should be obtained directly from the patient, as it could play the patient in a difficult situation.</p>
<h4 id="forced-hospitialization">Forced Hospitialization<a class="headerlink" href="#forced-hospitialization" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>In general, adult patients with intact decision-making capacity have the right to refuse treatment, even if it would be life-saving. However, protection of individual patient rights (patient autonomy) must be balanced with a <strong>physician's duty to protect the health of the public</strong> by mandating hospitalization and isolation of patients with a <strong>communicable disease</strong> (e.g. meningococcal meningitis).</p>
<p>Physicians should first encourage the patient to voluntarily comply with treatment by fully explaining the illness, the need for isolation, and the risk he poses to himself and others. The patient should also be educated about the potential harm he could cause if treated at home.</p>
<p>A patient who does not comply voluntarily needs to be hospitalized against his/her wishes. It is ethical for the physician to isolate a noncompliant patient until the patient no longer poses a risk. </p>
<h4 id="jehovahs-witness">Jehovah's Witness<a class="headerlink" href="#jehovahs-witness" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Most Jehovah's Witnesses carry advance directive cards that explicitly document the individual's refusal of a blood transfusion. In the case of adult patients, courts have consistently supported the right to refuse blood on religious grounds. Yet, The Health Care Consent Act has been applied to Jehovah's Witnesses to <strong>allow transfusion</strong> to preserve a patient's life in an <strong>emergency</strong> when no blood refusal card is present.</p>
<h4 id="maternal-fetal-ethics">Maternal-fetal Ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#maternal-fetal-ethics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Until delivery, the mother has complete <strong>autonomy</strong> for medical decisions affecting both herself and the fetus, including <strong>refusal of treatment</strong> (even if this leads to adverse fetal outcomes). In these scenarios, the rights of the mother are considered over those of the fetus. Therefore, pregnant women with capacity have the same right to refuse treatment (eg, emergency cesarean delivery) as nonpregnant patients, even if the decision does not represent the best interests of the fetus.</p>
<h4 id="cesarean-ethics">Cesarean Ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#cesarean-ethics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Although most <strong>cesarean deliveries</strong> are medically indicated (eg, breech presentation, fetal distress), a small number are performed <strong>on maternal request</strong> in the <strong>absence of maternal or fetal indications</strong>. After the risks and benefits of both cesarean and vaginal delivery are discussed, patients can choose their mode of delivery. Providers uncomfortable with performing a cesarean delivery on maternal request are <strong>not professionally or ethically required to perform the procedure</strong>. However, providers are responsible for ensuring continuous and comprehensive patient care. Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient is an early <strong>referral to another obstetric provider</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Informed consent</strong> provides patients with information that allows for educated decision-making about their health care. The procedure and its indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives should be clearly described. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Informed consent is typically required prior to performing any procedure on a patient; this respects patient autonomy, allowing patients to make educated decisions about their own health care. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A main <strong>exception</strong> to the rule is when a <strong>life-saving procedure</strong> is necessary in an <strong>emergency</strong> and obtaining consent is not possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="informed-refusal">Informed Refusal<a class="headerlink" href="#informed-refusal" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p><strong>Informed refusal</strong> is the <strong>negative corollary</strong> of informed consent: if appropriately informed, patients with decision-making capacity can refuse life-saving treatment (eg, intubation). However, this <strong>requires</strong> that the <strong>same information</strong> be discussed with the patient as is typically discussed for informed consent, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The diagnosis</li>
<li>The proposed procedure or treatment, along with its risks/benefits</li>
<li>Alternative treatment options, along with their risks/benefits</li>
<li>The risks of refusing treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>In the absence of informed refusal, the physician should act in the patient's best interest and proceed with life-saving procedure.</p>
<p>To establish informed refusal, we need to fully explore and assess the decision making progress and ability of the patient to ensure that that there is no misunderstanding. If the patient continues to refuse medical intervention despite clarification and reassurance from the physician, then this decision should be respected and treatment withheld.</p>

<p>When the patient is unemancipated, i.e. individual age &lt;18 years who requires consent by a parent or legal guardian for medical or surgical treatment, informed consent ideally is obtained from the <strong>parents of minors</strong> prior to performing a procedure. </p>
<ul>
<li>In patients with divorced parents, only parents with <strong>custody</strong> may give consent for medical care</li>
<li>Parents with joint custody are each able to consent, but consent from only <strong>one parent</strong> is all that is necessary to proceed with treating the minor, especially when the decision is clearly in the child's best interests. </li>
<li>In all cases, treatment is ideally discussed with both parents to reach an agreement that will help the child and facilitate cooperation between the treatment team and the parents.</li>
<li>If both parents refuse to consent to life-saving treatment, the physician would need to seek court approval before administering necessary but nonurgent treatment (eg, chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a stable patient).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>exception</strong> is <strong>emergency, life-threatening conditions</strong> in which the parent or legal guardian cannot or does not provide consent and delaying treatment would result in harm to the patient. Parents have the responsibility to make decisions in the <strong>best interest</strong> of their child and therefore <strong>cannot refuse life-saving treatment</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li>In situations that are not time-sensitive, the hospital legal counsel and ethics committee should be involved and a court order obtained to overrule the parent's wishes.</li>
<li>In time-sensitive situations, we should proceed with treatment regardless of parental consent.</li>

<h4 id="patients-leaving-against-medical-advice">Patients Leaving Against Medical Advice<a class="headerlink" href="#patients-leaving-against-medical-advice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>According to principles of patient autonomy, adult patients have the right to both <strong>decline initiation of treatment</strong> and <strong>terminate treatment</strong> already underway. In either case, the provider should advise the patient of the potential risks of refusing care but may not mandate that a competent patient submit to treatment.</p>
<p>In cases in which a patient chooses to prematurely discontinue treatment (eg, leaving a hospital <strong>against medical advice</strong> [AMA]), the provider should ensure that the patient has been clearly <strong>informed of the risks</strong> of doing so. If the patient still insists on discontinuing treatment, the principle of beneficence mandates that the provider <strong>continue to act in the patient's best interest</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Assess decision-making capacity</strong></p>
<p>Determine that the patient:</p>
<ul>
<li>understands the proposed treatment (&amp; alternatives, if applicable)</li>
<li>understands the risk of treatment refusal</li>
<li>demonstrates a reasoned basis for refusing treatment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Provide options for continued care</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offer alternate treatment that is acceptable to the patient (as appropriate)</li>
<li>Offer to resume care if the patient reconsiders</li>
<li>Offer assistance with outpatient/follow-up care</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deceased-patient-and-training">Deceased Patient and Training<a class="headerlink" href="#deceased-patient-and-training" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The ethical dilemma of using newly deceased patients for training purposes involves weighing the conflicting considerations of respect for patient integrity with the need to train health care providers to perform lifesaving procedures. The consensus of major medical organizations (eg, American Medical Association, American Heart Association's Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee, Society for Academic Emergency Medicine) is that <strong>it is ethical</strong> for students to perform procedures for training purposes as long as the physician <strong>obtains permission from</strong> the <strong>family</strong> (or the patient prior to death) before the student performs the procedures. The training must occur as part of a <strong>structured training</strong> sequence and be performed under <strong>close supervision</strong>.</p>
<p>If the patient's previously expressed consent is not documented and an appropriate family member cannot be found to grant permission, procedures for training purposes should not be performed. Physicians should also be aware that approaching a family for permission to perform procedures shortly after a death may be overwhelming and distressing.</p>

<h4 id="inappropriate-demand-to-be-seen">Inappropriate demand to be seen<a class="headerlink" href="#inappropriate-demand-to-be-seen" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>This physician is faced with a patient who <strong>inappropriately demands</strong> to be seen after hours for a non-urgent concern. A stable patient who fails to arrive at the appointed time should be advised to reschedule the appointment; the physician is under no obligation to immediately see this patient. Performing an examination after hours is inappropriate and reinforces the patient's sense of entitlement and poor boundaries. Acquiescing to the patient's demands would only encourage similar behavior in the future and create further tension in the physician-patient relationship due to the patient's lack of respect for the physician's time. </p>
<p>The most appropriate response is to calmly <strong>set limits</strong> and establish <strong>clear professional boundaries</strong>. The physician should explain in a polite yet firm tone that the examination will be deferred until the next day because the condition is not an emergency.</p>
<p>Several actions suggest that patient could have boundary issues. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrival at unscheduled times and/or at closing time (when others are less likely to be available)</li>
<li>Insistence on seeing the same physician for each visit (for mild conditions) and in private</li>
<li>Frequent return visits for nonspecific complaints</li>
<li>Health complaints that necessitate examination of private areas or undressing, despite recent normal findings</li>
</ul>
<p>When dealing with difficult patients, the physician must maintain professional conduct and responsibilities while addressing their medical and psychological needs.</p>

<p>To safeguard patients and preserve the reputation of doctors, the American Medical Association (AMA) guidelines (Opinion 8.061 - Gifts to Physicians from Industry) suggest <strong>accepting nonmonetary gifts</strong> from interested parties only if the gifts <strong>directly benefit patient care</strong> and are of <strong>small monetary value</strong> (eg, unbiased educational materials, drug samples). No gifts of cash or high value, or with implied reciprocity, should be accepted. The flash drive, although not of high monetary value, does not directly benefit patient care and should not be accepted.</p>

<p>Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going well, or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good.</p>
<p><em>—Václav Havel, b 1936, Czechoslovakian writer, politician, playwright</em></p>
<ul>
<li>First order: <strong>Denial of symptoms &rarr; Hope for recovery</strong></li>
<li>Second order: <strong>Denial of non-recovery &rarr; Hope beyond recovery</strong></li>
<li>To die with dignity;</li>
<li>For the continuing success of children;</li>
<li>That a partner will find the support they need;</li>
<li>That their life’s contribution will continue and be found useful.</li>
<li>Third order: <strong>Hope that faces existential extinction</strong></li>
<li>Finds a sense of ultimate meaning in the life that has been lived.</li>
<li>Such hope may hold to a belief in a life after death, but recognises this belief as a contingency of faith.</li>

<h4 id="dignity-conserving-care">Dignity conserving care<a class="headerlink" href="#dignity-conserving-care" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A core framework of dignity conserving care has been developed by Chochinov, with the aim of reminding practitioners about the importance of caring for, as well as caring about, their patients. The mnemonic ABCD stands for Attitude, Behaviour, Compassion and Dialogue</p>
<ul>
<li>Attitude: be respectful, acknowledging the patient as an individual with cognisance of many issues including culture and ethics</li>
<li>Behavior: An awareness of one’s attitude may lead to a more positive behaviour towards patients. Small acts of kindness and respect boost a patient’s sense of worth. Taking a little time to explain to patients what is happening dispels fear. Practising open and honest communication and giving patients full attention allows them to develop trust, thereby enabling more per- sonal and appropriate care</li>
<li>Compassion refers to a deep awareness of the suffering of another coupled with the wish to relieve it. Compassion is felt beyond simply intellectual appreciation. Compassion may be inherent in the healthcare provider and hopefully develops over time with both professional and life experience. Demonstrating compassion does not need to take time and can be both verbal and non-verbal.</li>
<li>Healthcare professionals speak to patients about their illness but may fail to touch on the issues that are most important to the patient, such as the emotional impact of the illness and the importance of being recognised as an individual and not another sick person. Healthcare decisions need to be taken considering not only the medical facts but also the life context of the patient. Psychotherapeutic approaches, such as life review or remi- niscence, can be used to support patients to regain or retain a sense of meaning, purpose and dignity.</li>

<p>In general, a patient has the right to know a diagnosis.  If family members ask for information to be withheld, it is imperative for the physician to understand their reasoning. Occasionally, it is in the patient's best interest to withhold especially distressing news (eg, if a severely depressed patient might become suicidal). Therefore, it is best to clarify the situation with the concerned family members first before deciding how best to proceed.</p>
<h4 id="handling-colleague-mistake">Handling Colleague Mistake<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-colleague-mistake" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Handling the aftermath of a mistake made by a colleague can be awkward, especially when the patient's family is pressing for detailed information. Nevertheless, it is the acting physician's obligation to discuss the essential truth with the patient in a tactful and concise manner. The colleague is not available in this case. Therefore, a brief and honest explanation should be provided to the patient with the understanding that a definitive answer will be available once the matter has been fully discussed with the colleague. In the meantime, the patient has evidence of acute renal injury likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and appropriate therapy should be started to treat her acute condition.</p>
<p>Physicians should consider admitting a mistake, especially under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actual patient harm</li>
<li>Clear or potential clinical significance</li>
<li>An unwanted treatment, device, or substance reaching the patient</li>
<li>An unanticipated outcome</li>

<h4 id="breaking-bad-news">Breaking Bad News<a class="headerlink" href="#breaking-bad-news" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p><strong>Breaking bad news</strong> is one of the most difficult situations a physician will encounter. A sensitive, <strong>patient-centered approach</strong> that is responsive to the patient's needs is preferred rather than expressing excessive sympathy or prematurely suggesting treatment options. An important <strong>first step</strong> is to <strong>find out how much</strong> the <strong>patient already knows</strong> and what the patient believes about his or her condition. This patient has a previous diagnosis of breast cancer, but to what extent she has been informed or understands her risk for metastatic disease is unclear. First listening to how the patient discusses her condition and fears will help the physician <strong>phrase the information accordingly</strong>. The physician can then communicate his or her suspicions and concerns in an empathic manner using language that is understandable to the patient, considering any religious or cultural issues, and adjusting the level of detail according to how much the patient wants to know.</p>
<p>Let the patient ask questions but do not overload him or her with too much information. Information may need to be repeated later after the emotion of the situation has been absorbed. Although each situation is different and the physician's response should be guided by the patient, a protocol such as <strong>SPIKES</strong> can be used for general guidance.</p>

<p>Patients are increasingly interested in <strong>complementary and alternative medicine</strong> (CAM), and physicians must be prepared to discuss CAM modalities with them and integrate treatments that have demonstrated safety and efficacy. The <strong>initial response</strong> to a patient who requests an alternative approach is to <strong>explore the reasons</strong> for requesting a <strong>different treatment</strong>.</p>
<p>This patient may be dissatisfied or have concerns about the quality of current care. She may be experiencing bothersome medication side effects of which the physician is unaware. Once the patient's reasons are clarified, the physician can discuss the <strong>risks and benefits</strong> of the proposed CAM treatment in addition to suggesting modifications to the current treatment regimen that may address her concerns.</p>

Interventions are geared to the patient's stage of <strong>readiness to change</strong>. Elements include a nonjudgmental stance focusing on the patient's intrinsic motivation to change, acknowledging ambivalence and resistance to change, and supporting the patient's autonomy and efforts to take responsibility.</p>

<p>An outlier is defined as an extreme and unusual value observed in a dataset.  It may be the result of a recording error, a measurement error, or a natural phenomenon.  An outlier can affect the measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) as well as the measures of dispersion (eg, standard deviation). The mean (mathematical average) is extremely sensitive to outliers and easily shifts toward them, especially with a small sample size. </p>

<p>p-value represents the probability of observing a given (or more extreme) result by chance alone, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

The closer r is to its margins (-1 or 1), the stronger the association.  In this study, as there was a negative correlation between HDL2 and carotid intima-media thickness (given r = -0.25 &lt;0), when there was an increase in one of the variables (eg, HDL2), there was a decrease in the other variable (eg, carotid intima-media thickness).

Observational studies can be subdivided into descriptive and analytical.  Descriptive epidemiology deals with the collection of data to characterize a specific health problem (eg, disease prevalence; incidence rates; distribution over time, location, and demographics).  Analytical epidemiology is used to test hypotheses generated after analyzing the data from descriptive studies (eg, risk factor associations).</p>

Post-hoc analysis can be problematic with non-predefined subgroup analysis.</td>

<tr>
<td>Latency Period</td>
<td>Latency is an important natural phenomenon of disease epidemiology.  Most infectious diseases have relatively short latency periods (ie, the time elapsed from initial exposure to clinically apparent disease).  In contrast, some disease processes (eg, cancer, heart disease) have a long latency period before clinical manifestations develop.<br><br>The concept of a latency period can also be extended to risk factors and risk reducers.  Sometimes, a significant amount of time must pass before exposure to a risk modifier has a clinically evident effect on the disease process.  In addition, exposure to a risk modifier may need to occur continuously over a certain period before the disease outcome is affected.  In this case, at least 1 year of high-dose statin therapy was required to show a significant protective advantage over moderate-dose therapy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawthorne Effect</td>
<td>Hawthorne effect can be defined as the tendency of a study population to affect the outcome because these people are aware that they are being studied.  This awareness leads to a consequent change in behavior while under observation, thereby seriously affecting the validity of the study.  Hawthorne effect is commonly seen in studies that concern behavioral outcomes or outcomes that can be influenced by behavioral changes.  In order to minimize the potential of the Hawthorne effect, studied subjects can be kept unaware that they are being studied; however, this may pose ethical problems.  Randomized control trials have a sense of uncertainty and risk due to randomization, which may be more potent behavior modifiers than mere observation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Confounding</td>
<td>Confounding is present when at least part of the exposure-disease relationship can be explained by another variable (confounder). The effects of confounding bias can be reduced through good study design and proper analysis of the results.  Methods used to control for confounding during data analysis include stratified analysis and statistical modeling (eg, multivariate analyses).  In addition, methods to control for confounders during <br> <strong>study design</strong> include the following: <br>- <strong>Matching</strong> is an efficient method to control confounding.  It is frequently used in case-control studies.  The initial step involves the selection of matching variables, which should always be the potential confounders (e.g., age, race).  Cases and controls are then selected based on the matching variables, such that both groups have a similar distribution in accordance with the variables. Matching: Frequently used in case-control studies, this method involves matching known or suspected confounding variables between the cases and controls.  For example, if smoking status is a known confounder, then controls will be selected on a case-by-case basis so that there are similar numbers of smokers and nonsmokers in both the case and control groups.<br> - <strong>Restriction</strong>: This method involves limiting study participation to individuals with specific characteristics.  For example, if sex is thought to be a confounder, then a restricted study may enroll only men.  However, this method is limited as the study results may not be applicable to the excluded population (ie, women).<br> - <strong>Randomization</strong>: Commonly employed in clinical trials, this technique helps to balance the distribution of confounding variables between treatment and placebo groups so that the unconfounded effect of the exposure of interest can be isolated.  An important advantage of randomization, compared to other methods, is the possibility of controlling known risk factors (eg, age and severity of heart failure) as well as the unknown and difficult-to-measure confounders (eg, level of stress and socioeconomic status).Randomization also eliminates partiality in treatment assignments, minimizing selection bias. <br><br> Analysis Stage <br>-stratified analysis <br>-statistical modeling</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Effect modification</td>
<td>Effect modification (interaction) results when an extraneous variable (modifier) changes the direction or strength of an association between a risk factor and a disease.  A modifier is associated with the disease but not the risk factor.  Effect modification can sometimes be confused with confounding, the bias that results when the exposure-disease relationship is obscured by the effect of an extraneous factor (confounder) associated with both exposure and disease.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Stratified analysis by the extraneous variable can help distinguish whether that variable is a confounder or an effect modifier, as follows:
- Confounder:  The measures of association (eg, relative risk [RR] of bladder cancer among alcohol users) calculated in each of the stratified groups (eg, smokers and nonsmokers) are similar to one another (eg, nonstatistically significant RR = 0.95 [95%CI: 0.51, 1.76] and RR = 1.03 [95%CI: 0.34, 3.13]), but they differ from the measure of association calculated in the crude analysis (eg, statistically significant RR = 1.81 [95%CI: 1.06, 3.10]); stratification can remove the effects of the confounder (eg, smoking).
- Effect modifier:  The measures of association calculated in each of the strata are significantly different (in strength or direction) from one another; stratification can make the effects of the modifier more apparent.</p>

<p>For example, ecological longitudinal studies using national data showed that lung cancer rates increased 2 decades after smoking rates increased.  Although this suggested an association between smoking and lung cancer, the ecological studies did not link cases of lung cancers with individual smokers; case-control and cohort studies were needed to further study the association.</p>

<p>Case control studies are analytical observational studies that retrospectively associate outcomes with specific risk factors. </p>
<p>The researcher begins by selecting cases with a certain outcome (eg, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis infection) and controls without that outcome (eg, pansensitive tuberculosis infection).

<p>In a case-control study design, patients with the disease of interest (cases) and people without the disease (controls) (presently) are asked about previous exposure to the variable being studied. </p>
<p>The main measure of association is the exposure odds ratio, in which the exposure of people with the disease (cases) is compared to the exposure of those without the disease (controls).</p>

<p>The null hypothesis of cross-sectional study represents a statement of no association between variables of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Prevalence odds ratio</strong> is calculated in cross-sectional studies to compare the prevalence of a disease between different populations. </p>
<p>As this is a cross-sectional study, the temporal relationship between the 2 variables (ie, whether the exposure preceded the outcome, or whether the outcome preceded the exposure) cannot be determined.</p>
<p>This is a passive epidemiological study.</p>

<p>Observational study
- Data gathered from the same individual over time
- Can assess risk factors or outcomes</p>
<p>Prospective cohort studies are analytical observational studies in which a group of exposed and unexposed individuals is followed prospectively over time for development of the outcome of interest.  Cohort studies are considered stronger than case control and cross sectional studies because of their greater ability to prove causation.</p>
<p>Null hypothesis is the presence of similar level of risk in subjects with and without the variable factor studied.</p>
<p>Relative risk and relative rate are calculated.  Median survival is calculated in cohort studies (and also in clinical trials), and is usually used to compare the median survival times in two or more groups of patients (e.g., receiving a new treatment or placebo).</p>
<p>This is a passive epidemiological study. It is especially suited to studying <strong>incidence</strong> of a disease: Incidence is defined as the number of new cases of a disease arising in an at-risk population over a specified time period.  Subjects without the disease are followed over a period of time to discover how many eventually develop that disease.  </p>

<p>A randomized control trial is an experimental study that is considered the gold standard for studying the efficacy of a treatment or procedure.  Subjects are randomly assigned to an experimental or control group and monitored for the outcome of interest.  This study design often has the least bias and provides the strongest evidence for a causal relationship.</p>

<p>Statistical biases can be divided into
1. Selection bias: results from the manner in which the subjects are selected for the study, or from the selective losses from the follow-up. 
2. Observational bias: inaccurate measurement or classification of disease, exposure, or other variables</p>

For instance, a study on cancer survival that is not limited to newly diagnosed patients will contain a higher proportion of relatively benign malignancies as these patients generally live longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prevalence (Neyman) bias</td>
<td>Neyman bias occurs if exposure is a prognostic factor that can impact survival.  Exposures that happen long before disease assessment can cause the study to miss diseased patients who die earlier.  In rapidly fatal diseases, the impact can be even more extreme.  For example, a hospital-based study on snow shoveling and myocardial infarction will miss patients who die in their driveways before reaching the hospital.</td>

<p>The z-test and t-test are used to compare two means, not proportions. </p>
<p>The two-sample t test is commonly employed to compare two means.  The basic requirements needed to perform this test are the two mean values, the sample variances, and the sample size.  The t statistic is then obtained to calculate the p value.  If the 'p' value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis (that there is no difference between two groups) is rejected, and the two means are assumed to be statistically different.  If the 'p' value is large, the null hypothesis is retained.</p>
<p>The two-sample z test can also be used to compare two means, but population (not sample) variances are employed in the calculations.  Because population variances are not usually known, the test has limited applicability.</p>

<p>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is generated by plotting the true-positive rate (sensitivity) against the false-positive rate (1 - specificity).</p>
<p>Important test parameters given by the ROC curve include the following:
1. Sensitivity: Indicates how well a test can screen for a disease.  A higher sensitivity makes it less likely that there are false negatives, meaning that a negative test better rules out the disease (snout).
2. Specificity: Indicates how well a test can confirm the diagnosis.  The higher the specificity, the less likely there are false positives, meaning that a positive test result better rules in the condition (spin).
3. Accuracy: Is defined as the proportion of true results (true positive and true negative) out of all the results of a given diagnostic test.  Test accuracy depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the test as well as the prevalence of the condition in the population being tested.  Accuracy increases as the total area under the ROC curve increases. Accuracy can be measured as the total area under the ROC curve.  The closer the plotted curve approaches the left and top borders of the graph, the more accurate the test.  In this case, the total area under the plotted curve increases with aspirin use (because the increase in sensitivity is larger than the decrease in specificity), leading to an overall increase in test accuracy.</p>
<p>Points labeled along the ROC curve represent different quantitative cutoff values for determining positive and negative test results.  As the cutoff point is modified, sensitivity and specificity are also changed.  With most ROC curves, an increase in sensitivity is offset by a decrease in specificity and vice versa.  The ideal diagnostic test is 100% sensitive and specific and provides the most useful information (square line).  In contrast, a diagnostic test that provides no useful information demonstrates an inverse linear relationship between sensitivity and specificity (straight line).</p>

<li>The natural history of the disease should be adequately understood.</li>
<li>There should be a latent stage of the disease.</li>
<li>There should be a test or examination for the condition.</li>
<li>There should be an agreed policy on who to treat.</li>
<li>There should also be effective treatment for the condition.</li>
<li>Facilities for diagnosis and treatment should be available.</li>
<li>The test should be acceptable to the population and the total cost of finding a case should be economically balanced in relation to medical expenditure as a whole. The potential benefits of early detection and treatment of a condition need to be weighed against many factors including: adverse side effects of the screening test, time and effort required (of both the patient and the healthcare system) to take the test, financial cost of the test, potential psychological and physical harm of false positive results (such as labeling and over-treatment), adverse effects of the treatment.</li>
<li>Case-finding should be a continuous process, not just a \"once and for all\" project.</li>
<li>An effective screening test should have very good sensitivity (identify most or all potential cases) and specificity (label incorrectly as few as possible as potential cases). Even a test with a sensitivity of 95% will lead to many false positives when the prevalence of the condition is very low.</li>

<h3 id="pneumococcal-vaccines">Pneumococcal Vaccines<a class="headerlink" href="#pneumococcal-vaccines" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>These vaccines work by <strong>relatively T-cell independent B-cell response</strong>. Each infectious serotype produces a distinct capsular polysaccharide, and anti-capsular antibodies formed during an immune response provide immunity against only a single serotype. As such, at-risk patients are given a pneumococcal vaccine containing multiple capsular antigens. Two types of vaccines are currently available for use in the United States:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</strong> (PPSV23) contains capsular material from 23 serotypes that have historically been responsible for the majority of pneumococcal infections. Because polysaccharides alone cannot be presented to T cells, the vaccine induces a relatively T-cell-independent B-cell response that is less effective in young children and the elderly.</li>
<li><strong>Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</strong> (PCV13) consists of capsular polysaccharides from 13 of the most common serotypes that have been covalently attached to inactivated diphtheria toxin protein. This polysaccharide-protein conjugate induces a T-cell-dependent B-cell response, resulting in improved immunogenicity due to the formation of higher-affinity antibodies and memory cells</li>
</ol>
<p>Routine administration of the PCV13 is recommended for <strong>all infants and young children</strong>. PPSV23 is administered to <strong>adults age &lt;65 with predisposing comorbidities</strong> (eg, chronic heart or lung disease, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis). <strong>Immunocompromised patients</strong> and <strong>all individuals age &gt;65</strong> should receive both vaccines to maximize protection.</p>

<p>The <strong>diphtheria–tetanus–acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine</strong> is a combination vaccine containing acellular pertussis antigen with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. Combination vaccines are safe, effective at preventing infection, and beneficial in reducing the number of needlesticks required (resulting in decreased pain and improved compliance). Children should receive 5 doses of the inactivated DTaP vaccine at ages <strong>2, 4, and 6 months; 15-18 months; and 4-6 years</strong>.</p>
<p>Postexposure antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for close contacts (eg, household, day care) of anyone with pertussis within the last 21 days. Because this child was exposed to pertussis 6 weeks ago, prophylactic antibiotics are no longer required.</p>
<p>The risk of an adverse reaction to the DTaP vaccine is low and generally includes minor erythema/swelling at the injection site and/or fever. <strong>Seizure</strong>, triggered by fever or by the pertussis vaccine component, is <strong>rare</strong> and is typically short (&lt;5 minutes) and self-limited, as in this child. Patients with a family history of febrile seizures or epilepsy may be at increased risk. However, neither personal nor family history of seizures is a contraindication to immunization. Specifically, uncomplicated seizure following vaccine administration is <strong>not a contraindication</strong> to future vaccination. The benefit of DTaP vaccination, especially in the setting of a pertussis outbreak, outweighs the unlikely risk of significant side effects.</p>
<p>The DTaP vaccine is contraindicated in a few circumstances. </p>
<ul>
<li>When <strong>anaphylaxis</strong> develops following DTaP administration, the patient should not receive future dose**. **</li>
<li>In addition, <strong>unstable neurologic disorders</strong> (eg, infantile spasms, uncontrolled epilepsy) and <strong>encephalopathy</strong> (ie, coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) within a week of DTaP vaccine administration are <strong>contraindications</strong> to the combination vaccine; as a result, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids should be administered without pertussis</li>

<p><em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> cause the most common bacterial <strong>sexually transmitted infections</strong> (STIs) in young adults but are often asymptomatic, particularly in young women. Both STIs can cause cervicitis, which if undetected and left untreated, can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease with its associated complications (eg, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain) and increase the likelihood of HIV transmission.</p>
<p>For these reasons, <strong>annual screening</strong> for <strong>chlamydia and gonorrhea</strong> is recommended in <strong>sexually active women age &lt;25</strong>, as well as those with other risk factors (eg, multiple sexual partners, illicit drug use). Patients who test positive should receive antibiotics immediately and refrain from sexual intercourse until treatment is complete. <strong>All sexual partners from the preceding 2 months</strong> should also be tested and treated.</p>

<h3 id="definitions-of-death">Definitions of Death<a class="headerlink" href="#definitions-of-death" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Definitions of death is controversial. There are three main ones at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Circulatory Definition of Death (DCDD): circulatory and respiratory functions cease</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem: cessation of these functions are not always irreversible, therefore careful definitions of permanent and irreversible are required</li>
<li>Problem: without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of life support devices, organ transplants and artificial pacemakers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brain death / Biological death: irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain (some argues for only neo-cortex)</p>
<ul>
<li>It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of consciousness; this is a reliable and reproducible criteria and the brain is crucial in determining our identity or who we are as human beings.</li>
<li>Problem:    <ul>
<li>mechanically ventilated patients who are brain dead can retain a large array of biological functions such as the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete waste, heal wounds, fight infections, and to gestate fetuses (if pregnant).</li>
<li>EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain drugs, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, or hypothermia can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis.</li>
<li>In cases of electric shock, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned nerves to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. People found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an emergency room. This \"diving response\", in which metabolic activity and oxygen requirements are minimal, is something humans share with cetaceans called the mammalian diving reflex.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information-theoretic death: The structures that encode memory and personality have been so disrupted that it is no longer possible in principle to recover them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently only used in cryonics</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1995, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), established a set of three criteria that became the medical standard for diagnosing neurologic death:
-   coma with clear etiology
-   cessation of breathing
-   and lack of brainstem reflexes</p>

<p>Loss of homeostasis, leads to cardiac arrest, causing loss of oxygen and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the brain and other tissues.</p>

<p>Steps when you have been asked to confirm the death of a patient:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go through Medical History</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of history or physical examination findings that provide a clear etiology of brain dysfunction</li>
<li>Exclusion of any condition that might confound the subsequent examination of cortical or brain stem function</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform Physical Examination You should observe the patient for a minimum of 5 minutes. To ensure that you perform all necessary steps, you can use a systematic <strong>A to E approach</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Airway / Breathing -- Auscultate the lungs for >1min</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be no respiratory effort and no audible breath sounds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Circulation -- Palpate for a pulse for >1min and auscultate the heart for >1min</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be no palpable central pulse and no audible heart sounds*</li>
<li>Make sure you check for any palpable cardiac pacemaker</li>
<li>EEG is shows asystole</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disability -- Check for a pupillary response and check for a motor response to pain</p>
<ul>
<li>Following 5 minutes of continued cardio-respiratory arrest the patient's pupils will be fixed, dilated and unresponsive to light.</li>
<li>There will be no response to a painful stimulus. This can be tested by applying supra-orbital pressure and looking for any motor response.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exposure -- The patient may be peripherally cold (depending on the timing of your assessment)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notify next of kin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certification and brain death documentation</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>DATE 02/12, TIME: 2310: DEATH CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>Is there a pace maker and has it been removed?</p>
<p>No audible breath or heart sounds for greater than 1 minute.</p>
<p>No palpable pulse for greater than 1 minute. No palpable cardiac pacemaker.</p>
<p>Pupils are fixed, dilated and unreactive to light.</p>
<p>There is no response to painful stimulus.</p>
<p>The patient has died.</p>
<p>Diagnosis</p>
<p>Duration of diagnosis</p>

<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is aging the same as senescence?</li>
</ul>
<p>Senescence or biological aging is the gradual deterioration of functional characteristics. The word senescence can refer either to cellular senescence or to senescence of the whole organism.</p>
<p>Senescence is the inevitable fate of all multicellular organisms with germ-soma separation, but it can be delayed or accelerated:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>calorie restriction can extend lifespan by 50% in rats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some organisms such as Hydra have negligible senescence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rare human mutation can cause accelerated aging (i.e. Progeroid syndromefs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exposure to ultraviolet radiation accelerates skin aging</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Biological aging and chronological aging are also different concepts because organisms from the same species can age at different speeds.</p>
<p><strong>Gompertz--Makeham law of mortality</strong> says that that the age-dependent component of the mortality rate increases exponentially with age.</p>
<p>In 2013, Lopez-Otin et al defined nine hallmarks of aging that are common between organisms with emphasis on mammals:</p>
<ol>
<li>genomic instability,</li>
<li>telomere attrition,</li>
<li>epigenetic alterations,</li>
<li>loss of proteostasis,</li>
<li>deregulated nutrient sensing,</li>
<li>mitochondrial dysfunction,</li>
<li>cellular senescence,</li>
<li>stem cell exhaustion,</li>
<li>altered intercellular communication.</li>
</ol>
<p>Aging has been defined as <em>\"a progressive deterioration of physiological function, an intrinsic age-related process of loss of viability and increase in vulnerability.\"</em> It is characterized by</p>
<ul>
<li>the declining ability to respond to stress</li>
<li>increased homeostatic imbalance</li>
<li>increased risk of aging-associated diseases including cancer and heart disease</li>
