### OBGYN Physical Exam

#### The Uterus

Normal uterus is not larger than eight weeks in size, approximately the size of a clenched fist. A normal uterus may be mildly tender on exam just prior to or during menses. A normal uterus can be tilted anteriorly (anteverted or anteflexed), midline, or tilted posteriorly (retroverted or retroflexed). An anteflexed or retroflexed uterus may be difficult to assess for size because of its position. The uterus should be smooth in contour around the entire surface area.

### Tocometer Reading

#### Non-Stress Test Strip

A non-stress test is an assessment of fetal well being in the antepartum period, before labor. Remember, the red line is fetal heart rate (FHR), the pink line is fetal movement, and the black line is uterine contractions. Each thin vertical line on the graph represents ten seconds, and each thick vertical line represents one minute. The approach to reading a non-stress test strip is

-   First check the FHR. A normal FHR has a baseline between 110 and 160 beats per minute with variability of 6 to 25 beats per minute.

-   Next, determine whether the strip is 'reactive' or not. A neurologically intact and healthy fetus should have two heart rate accelerations of at least 15 beats per minute over at least 15 seconds in a 20-minute period, which is called a 'reactive' strip.

For someone in labor, admitted to the birthing unit, they are not required to have a reactive NST in order to be considered reassuring. For an antepartum patient with medical issues indicating fetal well-being testing and one whom you may consider sending home if she is not in labor, performing a non-stress test is appropriate.

#### Category I, II, III Intrapartum Strips

Look at the criteria for Category I, II, and III intrapartum strips. Once a woman is admitted in labor, we categorize fetal heart tracings in this way, rather than using the criteria for non-stress tests, which are most useful in the antepartum period. The general approach to reading the strips is

1.  Consider the uterine activity

2.  Determine the baseline FHR

3.  Determine the heart rate variability

4.  Look for accelerations

5.  Look for decelerations

Category I

-   Normal FHR (baseline 110-160)

-   Moderate variability (between 6 and 25 beats per minute changes that are not accels or decels)

-   Plus or minus accelerations (at least 15 beats per minute above the baseline for at least 15 seconds from start to finish)

-   Plus or minus early decelerations (mirror contractions, nadir of deceleration with peak of contraction and resolves when contraction resolves - usually indicates fetal head compression when the fetus is low in the pelvis, often occurs with pushing)

-   No late or variable decelerations

Category II: Any fetal heart rate tracing that does not fit into Category I or III.

Category III: No fetal heart rate variability (absent) PLUS at least one of the following:

-   FHR baseline less than 110 (bradycardia)

    -   Severe prolonged bradycardia of less than 80 bpm that lasts for three minutes or longer is an ominous finding indicating severe hypoxia and is often a terminal event.

-   Recurrent late decelerations (occur with more than 50% of contractions in a 20 minute period)

    -   Late decelerations are decelerations in the fetal heart rate that begin after a contraction begins, with the nadir after the peak of the contraction.

    -   They can be an indication of utero-placental insufficiency, meaning that the baby may not be getting enough oxygen and late decelerations can be an early sign of hypoxemia during contractions.

-   Recurrent variable decelerations

    -   variable decelerations which are a decrease in fetal heart rate that vary in timing, duration, and intensity.

    -   It often looks like the letter \"V\" and does not necessarily correspond to contractions.

    -   indicate cord compression

OR Sinusoidal fetal heart rate pattern (smooth undulations of fetal heart rate in a sine wave like pattern). This pattern is rare and is considered an agonal pattern in a fetus near death.

Fetal tachycardia is a baseline fetal heart rate \>160 bpm. Tachycardia \>180 bpm is severe. Tachycardia greater than 200 bpm is usually due to fetal tachyarrhythmia or congenital anomalies.

### Preconception Counseling

1.  Vitamin supplementation: Daily supplementation with 400 to 800 micrograms of folic acid is recommended, as many pregnancies are unplanned. This lowers the risk for neural tube defects by over 70%. Patients with a history of miscarriage or fetuses affected by neural tube defects should be counseled to take a higher dose.

2.  Substance use: Substances such as alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, or other substances (marijuana, opioids, stimulants, etc.) should be discontinued (or, in the case of caffeine, at least cut back). Evidence is growing that marijuana can have detrimental effects on the fetus, even though it is more widely accepted. We recommend a sensitive approach to help patients with addiction cut down on substances when they are ready.

3.  Immunizations: Check for immunizations that must be given prior to pregnancy because they are live, such as MMR and chickenpox. Guidelines suggest Tdap during each pregnancy, influenza if indicated by time of year, and testing for rubella immunity if there is not clear evidence of vaccination with the MMR vaccine.

4.  Chronic conditions: Get any chronic medical problems---such diabetes, depression, asthma/COPD, or thyroid disorders---under control prior to pregnancy.

### Stages of Labor

#### Overview

First stage

-   latent phase: regular contractions have started, but the cervix is less than 6 cm dilated

-   active phase: begins when 6 cm dilated; ends when fully dilated

    -   Active labor is associated with strong regular contractions every three to five minutes and a cervical dilation of more than 6 cm in the setting of contractions.

    -   It is important to diagnose women with active labor prior to admitting them to the hospital for expectant management. Admitting women prior to active labor, in the latent labor stage, is associated with more interventions, including augmentation of labor (e.g. with medications such as oxytocin or other interventions) and cesarean delivery.

Second stage: begins at full dilation; ends when the baby is delivered

Third stage: begins with birth of the baby; ends with delivery of the placenta

#### Cardinal Movements of Labor

1.  Engagement: The presenting part of the fetus has entered the pelvic inlet.

2.  Descent: Described by the \"station\" on cervical exam. The fetus is at 0 station when the widest part of the presenting part is between the ischial spines.

3.  Flexion: When a fetus is in the occiput anterior position, the fetal head is flexed by the soft and bony tissues of the maternal pelvis, which facilitates passage through the birth canal.

4.  Internal rotation: The fetal head must rotate in order to further descend

5.  Extension: Occurs as the fetal head passes under the symphysis pubis, which occurs during crowning and delivery of the head

6.  External rotation: The head rotates to realign with the shoulders (also called restitution)

7.  Expulsion: Completing the delivery, with the anterior shoulder of the fetus being pushed out first, then the posterior shoulder and the rest of the body.

#### Management of late decelerations

1.  Continuous fetal monitoring.

2.  Position the patient on her side to decrease pressure on her vena cava, and increase blood return to the heart, in order to maximize cardiac output and blood flow to the uterus.

3.  Monitor blood pressure. If her blood pressure is low, she may benefit from a fluid bolus to further increase blood flow to the uterus.

4.  Oxygen by face mask, to maximize placental oxygen delivery. Although there is no clear evidence to support this, it is unlikely to cause harm with short term use, other than minimal patient discomfort.

#### Pain Management

-   Epidural

-   Intradermal sterile water injections in the back

-   Self-hypnosis

-   Acupuncture

-   IV opioids

-   Water immersion

-   Inhaled nitrous oxide

#### Active management of second stage of labor

-   When women are lying on their back pushing, you can protect the perineum by putting pressure posteriorly with one hand (to avoid extensive posterior perineal lacerations) and gently helping the fetal vertex to stay flexed with two fingers of the other hand (to avoid anterior perineal lacerations from over extension). This should only be done during crowning and every effort should be made to avoid episiotomy unless necessary for fetal distress or dystocia.

-   There is good evidence that avoiding routine episiotomy protects women from unnecessary perineal trauma, but the evidence for the other perineal protection techniques is weaker and has not been well-studied.

-   After the head delivers, allow the head to restitute while you gently feel around the fetal neck to determine if a nuchal cord is present.

#### Active management of third stage of labor

-   Decrease maternal blood loss

    -   Give the mother Pitocin (oxytocin) after the baby is born to help the placenta detach quicker,

    -   very gently pull on the cord when the placenta appears to have detached,

    -   massage the uterus after the placenta comes out to help the blood vessels stop pumping out blood (limited evidence)

-   Timing of clamping of the umbilical cord\
    There is evidence that delaying cord clamp can decrease the risk of anemia in newborns and infants. Most of the studies and guidelines show that 30 to 60 seconds of delay is about the right amount of time, except when immediate transition of the newborn to the nursery team is indicated for other reasons.

#### Caring for the Newborn

Compute the APGAR score at 1 and 5 minutes

-   Appearance: 0 - all blue, 1 - only extremities blue, 2 - all pink

-   Pulse: 0 - no heartbeat, 1 bpm, 2 - \>100 bpm

-   Grimace: 0 - no reaction to stimulus, 1 - reaction / grimace, 2 - grimacing and a cough, sneeze, or vigorous cry.

-   Activity / Tone: 0 - loose and floppy, 1 - some muscle tone, 2 - active motion.

-   Respiration: 0 - not breathing, 1 - slow or irregular, 2 - cries well.

A thorough newborn examination should be performed within 24 hours of birth.

-   Examine the head, looking for abnormalities of shape and size, size and condition of the fontanelles, and any masses.

-   Look in the eyes at the conjunctiva and sclera, as well as observe the red reflex with an ophthalmoscope.

-   Make sure both nares are patent and that the palate is intact.

-   Examine the size, shape and position of the ears.

-   Examine the neck for any masses.

-   Listen to the heart and lungs.

-   Check the abdomen for any masses and look for signs of infection at the umbilical stump.

-   Examine the skin for jaundice, rashes and congenital lesions.

-   Examine the hips to evaluate for developmental dysplasia of the hip, as well asfeel for the brachial and femoral pulses, that they are equal and symmetric.

-   Examine the penis for size and placement of the meatus; examine the scrotal sac and the testes to ensure that they are both descended.

-   Examine the back to look for any spine abnormalities or subtle signs of neural tube defects, such as a sacral cleft.

-   The neurological exam will consist of checking for resting tone, movement of all extremities, and checking neonatal reflexes, including the suck, rooting, grasp and moro reflexes. See the video for more information.

### Digital Cervical Exam

How to Perform Digital Cervical Exam

-   It is generally best to wait to do the exam in between contractions. Use a sterile glove with a generous amount of lubricating jelly. Place your index and middle fingers of your dominant hand at the introitus, using you other hand to separate the labia if necessary.

-   Ask the patient to take a deep breath and then exhale. As she exhales, insert your finger into the vagina and reach until you can feel the cervix, which is usually firmer than the vaginal wall tissue, especially early in labor. Sometimes, when the cervix is still posterior (early in labor) it helps to ask the woman to place her hands under her buttocks and tilt her pelvis towards the ceiling if you cannot find the cervix initially.

-   Once you feel the cervix, trace it around until you feel the opening in the center. Then put your fingers into the opening (external os) until you feel the presenting part (hopefully, the fetal vertex!).

-   Once you feel the fetal vertex, you can be confident that you are through the internal os. Spread your two fingers to determine how many centimeters the internal os is dilated. Remember that in a multiparous woman, the external os may be dilated several centimeters even when the internal os is still closed. This is why it is important to make sure that you are touching the presenting part to be sure that you are through the internal os. If you cannot feel a presenting part or membranes, but feel a \"fleshy\" end to the cervical canal, then the internal os is probably still closed.

-   In a dilated cervix, once you have determined how many centimeters dilated the internal os is, try to determine the thickness of the cervix. This can only accurately be done by exam when the cervix is dilated enough to admit at least one finger. Then try to feel using the sides of your fingers how thick the cervix is. A pregnant, non-labored cervix is usually **at least 3 cm in thickness**. So, 1.5 cm would be about 50% effaced and so on. Remember that the cervices of primiparous women usually efface first and then dilate, so their cervix may be very thin once they start to dilate, whereas, those of multiparous women do both at the same time and their cervix may still be relatively thick even when they are quite dilated.

Contraindication for Digital Cervical Exam

-   Patient report of vaginal bleeding with an undocumented placental location (or a known low-lying placenta or placenta previa.) Digital cervical exam may worsen bleeding.

-   Patient report of leaking vaginal fluid with known prematurity (or known preterm premature rupture of membranes - PPROM.) Digital cervical exam may introduce bacterial into the uterus.

Breast Problems
---------------

Female Reproductive Organ Developmental Problems
------------------------------------------------

### Imperforated Hymen

One of the most common obstructive lesions of the female genital tract

-   Presentation:

    -   At birth: vaginal secretion stimulated by mother's estrogen may cause mucocolpos (accumulation of mucous in vaginal canal) which may manifest as a bulging introitus

    -   Puberty: remained asymptomatic after the initial mucus gets reabsorbed and only upon menarche starts to have eugonadotropic amenorrhea, cyclic abdominal / pelvic pain, hematocolpos resulting in difficulty with defecation and urination

### Mullerian Duct Agenesis

Case: 16 year old Caucasian female presents to office with amenorrhea. She has never had menses, is 175 cm tall weights 65 kg and has fully developed secondary sexual characteristics. Pelvic examination shows shortened vaginal canal and rudimentary uterus.

-   Presentation

    -   Normal female development: breast and pubic and axillary hair

-   Diagnosis

    -   Normal range female testosterone

Cervical Problems
-----------------

### Cervical Polyps

-   Most common in postpartum and perimenopausal women; rare in pre-menstrual and post-menopausal women.

-   Although cervical polyps are rare in post-menopausal women, they can occur and if present, can cause vaginal bleeding.

### Certival Stenosis

Cervical stenosis can be congenital or acquired. With congenital stenosis an adolescent will have significant dysmenorrhea, which is not as responsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications as would be expected. The menstrual flow will also be minimal. Acquired stenosis may be related to cryotherapy or LEEP procedures (performed for concerns of cervical cancer on Pap tests and colposcopy biopsies). This causes dysmenorrhea as the uterus is distended with blood. On exam the uterus will feel diffusely enlarged.

Uterine and Menses Problems
---------------------------

### Premenstrual Syndrome

-   Presentation

    -   Occurs in the second half of a patient's cycle. It typically occurs in the five days before menses and must be present in at least three cycles for diagnosis. There has to be an effect on the patient's life (aside from pain) to count as premenstrual syndrome.

    -   It has physical symptoms like bloating, fatigue, and breast tenderness.

    -   The patient also may have behavioral symptoms like irritability, easy crying, and eating more than the rest of the month.

-   Management

    -   Danazol (GnRH agonists leuprolide) is an androgenic medication with progesterone effects. It lowers estrogen and inhibits ovulation. However, its multiple androgenic side effects, including weight gain, suppressing high density lipids, and hirsutism, limit its desirability among patients. GnRH agonists, such as leuprolide, are effective at treating premenstrual syndrome through ovulation inhibition. However, their anti-estrogen effects, including hot flashes and vaginal dryness, make these not as popular.

    -   Oral contraceptives are effective treatment for dysmenorrhea, anovulation, and in some cases menorrhagia. While not always effective for premenstrual syndrome, they are a good place to start. It would be appropriate to try this in a person also needing birth control. One study demonstrates potential improved effectiveness by decreasing the placebo pills to four days from seven. Additionally, pills can be taken for sequential cycles, skipping the placebo week, to reduce the frequency of menstruation and, theoretically, the rate of PMS/PMDD.

    -   Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) during menses are an effective treatment of PMS, especially if severe mood symptoms predominate.

        -   There are three effective regimens for SSRI use. One regimen is continuous daily treatment. Another is intermittent treatment, which is just as effective as daily treatment for decreasing both psychological and physical symptoms during menses. There are two types of intermittent treatment. One method is to start therapy 14 days prior to menses (luteal phase of cycle) and continue until menses starts. The second method is to start on the first day a patient has symptoms and continue until the start of menses or three days later.

        -   Many randomized trials have used fluoxetine and sertraline. Venlafaxine can be used as well. Lower doses are effective. If one medication does not work, another in the same class should be tried prior to considering the treatment a failure.

        -   Follow-up should occur after two to four cycles. Intermittent treatment is associated with fewer side effects and lower cost.

-   Additional Notes

    -   Hysterectomy is not effective for premenstrual syndrome as it does not alter hormonal balance in people with a uterus. Oophorectomy, however, is a potential surgical treatment for severe refractory cases in those done with childbearing.

### Premenstrual dysphoric disorder

the more severe form of PMS and is classified in the DSM-5 as a mental disorder.

-   The patient must have one of the following: marked mood lability, irritability or anger, depressed mood or feeling hopeless, or anxiety and edginess.

-   The patient must also have one of the following: food cravings, changes in sleep, a sense of being overwhelmed or out of control, decreased energy, anhedonia, and some physical symptoms.

The patient must have a minimum of five symptoms out of the above groups. How these are expressed may differ based on culture and social norms. It may be helpful to get the perspective of other close contacts of the patient.

### Primary Dysmenorrhea

Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as the onset of painful menses without pelvic pathology. Secondary dysmenorrhea is defined as painful menses secondary to some additional pathology.

Primary dysmenorrhea is associated with increasing amounts of prostaglandins. The actual prevalence is unknown but ranges from 20% to 90%. Ten to fifteen percent of assigned females feel their symptoms are severe and have to miss school or work. Dysmenorrhea usually occurs hours to a day prior to the onset of menses and lasts up to 72 hours.

Risk Factors for Primary Dysmenorrhea

-   Mood disorders such as depression or anxiety have been associated with dysmenorrhea, especially in adolescents. This may be a complex association as other factors may be comorbid with the mood disorder diagnosis, and the cause and effect is not well proven. However, there is an association with stress independently as a risk factor for dysmenorrhea.

-   There is also an association between tobacco use and dysmenorrhea.

-   Females who have more children are noted to have a decreased incidence of primary dysmenorrhea.

-   Additionally, females who report overall lower state of health or other social stressors have a tendency for dysmenorrhea. These stressors include social, emotional, psychological, financial, or family stressors.

-   Primary dysmenorrhea most commonly occurs in females in their teens and twenties. It is notably associated with ovulatory cycles. Classically, an adolescent will start experiencing dysmenorrhea one or two years after menarche. This is the time it takes naturally for an adolescent to develop regular ovulatory cycles. The earlier the onset of menarche the more likely dysmenorrhea may occur.

A detailed history regarding the nature of menses during adolescence and after children is important. It will also be important to ask about birth control and what types have been used as some can alter the symptoms.

Management

-   First-line: NSAID e.g. ibuprofen

-   Second-line: oral contraceptive pills

In a family physician's office, primary dysmenorrhea in an adolescent is a common diagnosis.

In a person with a uterus who is under 20 and not sexually active with the classic history of suprapubic pain the first two days of menses, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be started without a pelvic exam.

Ibuprofen is the gold-standard anti-inflammatory, but many other anti-inflammatories have also been proven equally efficacious when taken cyclically starting a day or two prior to the onset of menses and continuing into the first days of menses.

Choice of the specific anti-inflammatory to use should be based on cost and side effects the patient experiences. If anti-inflammatories are not effective, combination birth control pills (monophasic or triphasic) with medium-dose estrogen are effective. Some people will prefer to avoid hormonal options if possible.

A pregnancy test should be performed in an adolescent or anyone with a uterus who is sexually active with someone who has a penis. Other testing should be added if the patient has any type of dysfunctional uterine bleeding or pelvic pain outside of the typical pattern. For instance, consideration of polycystic ovary syndrome may be considered for irregular menstruation.

### Uterine Leiomyomas

Patho:

-   Proliferation of smooth muscle cells within the myometrium

Presentation:

-   Profuse menses with irregular uterine enlargement

Tx:

-   Oral contraceptives can decrease bleeding duration and volume but not completely resolve symptoms.

-   Acupuncture

-   Combined hormonal birth control (pills, patch, Nuva-ring)

-   Copper intrauterine device

-   Depo-Provera

-   Hysterectomy

-   Progesterone-releasing intrauterine device

-   Uterine artery embolization

    A Progesterone-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) is an effective option for reducing menstrual blood flow in those with menorrhagia secondary to fibroids. Another advantage is that it can be left in for five years (potentially longer but not yet widely accepted yet). There are potential complications, particularly during the procedure to place the device, but after appropriately discussing these with a patient it is a viable option. In studies, the progesterone-releasing IUD (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) has clearly demonstrated decreased menstrual flow in those with fibroids. In one smaller study, the device decreased overall uterine volume. However, it does not decrease the size of individual fibroids already in the uterus. Through decreasing uterine volume and endometrial atrophy, the progesterone-releasing IUD can also decrease dysmenorrhea. In people who hope to maintain fertility for the future yet control their symptoms now, this is one of the best options with fewest side effects. Irregular vaginal bleeding, especially initially, is a common side effect of the progesterone-releasing IUD. Other potential side effects are lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness. The risk of uterine perforation is more likely at the time of insertion. The risk of infection is within the first 20 days of insertion. Routine STI testing may be performed prior to or during insertion with immediate treatment if any infection is found. Good patient instructions to monitor for foul smelling discharge and signs of systemic infection or perforation are key.

    Acupuncture has been used for many pain conditions. Some studies demonstrate effectiveness for dysmenorrhea without uterine pathology when compared to sham or placebo treatments. In further studies, acupuncture improves quality of life but may be associated with higher health costs for the patient. Other nonmedical and nonsurgical treatment considerations for dysmenorrhea include TENS unit (transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation), thiamine supplementation, and, possibly, vitamin E supplementation. These may be offered to patients who are opposed to other treatments or in combination with other medical treatments.

    Combined hormonal contraceptives would be an effective option if the patient has not experienced side effects from these in the past. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) have been proven effective when used for dysmenorrhea related to anovulation only without a structural problem, especially in a patient who needs birth control. In those with isolated dysmenorrhea, small trials have demonstrated benefit. However, a meta-analysis of these found insufficient evidence that oral combined hormonal pills are effective for dysmenorrhea alone. The confusion is that OCPs are often used in structural problems of the uterus that cause both menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea. In leiomyoma and adenomyosis, OCPs decrease blood loss and may decrease dysmenorrhea by thinning the endometrial lining. OCPs are commonly known to patients and providers making them often the initial step in management. In adolescents, they have the additional benefit of regulated menses. However, other options that are not oral, such as the vaginal ring ring and the hormonal patch, are worth considering. These may cause less nausea and vomiting as they bypass the gastrointestinal system altogether. All types of combined hormonal contraceptives have slightly increased risk of venous thromboembolism, highest in the first year of use. For this reason, these types are not recommended in smokers older than 35 years. Specific side effects with the patch may be site dermatitis in as many as 20% of users. The vaginal ring has risks of leukorrhea and vaginitis in approximately 5% of patients; the other types do not. None of these worsen cervical dysplasia or have been proven to increase the risk of breast cancer.

    Injectable medroxyprogesterone is another potential treatment for leiomyomas and the symptoms associated with them. However, recent literature does demonstrate that there is bone density loss after several years of use. Other side effects may include weight gain, irregular menses for weeks to months, and potential mood changes. However, there is no risk of venous thromboembolism and this can be used in a smoker older than 35. This is a great choice for transgender men as it can help decrease periods without additional estrogen or a traumatizing procedure.

    Hysterectomy is the definitive surgical option for those with secondary dysmenorrhea and those with menorrhagia who no longer desire to bear children. In a meta-analysis, surgery has been proven to reduce bleeding more at one year than any other medical treatment. However, medical treatments may have less morbidity depending on the exact etiology of menorrhagia. Some surgeons will offer hysterectomy to a person with a uterus 14 to 16 weeks in size or greater whether or not the patient has symptoms. Any leiomyoma that is growing rapidly, regardless of the rest of the uterine exam, may be an indication for hysterectomy. For a patient who has failed other management, hysterectomy may be an option. Myomectomy, in which the clinician removes the leiomyoma but not the entire uterus, is another surgical option. Consideration of a patient's future reproductive plans are important in distinguishing these two options. Other procedural options for dysmenorrhea unrelated to uterine pathology include presacral neurectomy and uterine nerve ablation, both via laparoscopy, though there is insufficient evidence to recommend those in most cases.

    The copper IUD is another effective form of birth control. This device may stay inside the uterus for up to 10 years. For those who are not planning any children in the near future, this may be a viable option for birth control. An advantage of the copper IUD is that it has no hormones. However, in people using this, there is an increased risk of dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia just from the IUD. It is not a treatment for leiomyomas at all. In this case it could potentially make the symptoms worse.

    Since all patients undergoing uterine artery embolization must understand the potential for urgent hysterectomy, consideration of future fertility is imperative. Some consider this a relative contraindication. Post procedure, the patient usually has pelvic pain for at least 24 hours, sometimes lasting up to 14 days. \"Post-embolization syndrome\" is a group of signs and symptoms that include pain, cramping, vomiting, fatigue, and sometimes fever and leukocytosis. Other complications from the procedure to consider as you counsel this patient are potential ovarian failure (up to 3% in women younger than 45), infection, necrosis of fibroids, and vaginal discharge and bleeding for up to two weeks. This treatment is usually reserved for those who cannot tolerate other hormonal treatments or who do not want those treatments for other reasons. This procedure is usually performed by an interventional radiologist. It is not an option for dysmenorrhea alone or for menorrhagia without uterine fibroids.

Epidemiology: Fibroids are the most common benign tumors of the uterus. Decreased risk of developing fibroids has been noted with oral contraceptive use, increasing parity, and smoking. Increased risk is known with early menarche, family history of fibroids, and increased alcohol use. Although more research needs to be done exploring the causes of fibroids that include a more racially diverse pool, there seems to be a disproportionately high rate of fibroid development in African American women as compared to other racial demographic groups. Disparities also exist in the type of care that women receive for their fibroids; for example, studies have shown that Caucasian women are more likely to be offered a laparoscopic procedure as compared to African American and Hispanic women with the same household income, indicating systemic disparities in care.

Pathophysiology: These are made of normal myometrial cells. They can occur within the cavity and under the endometrium (submucosal), within the myometrium (intramural), on the serosal surface (serosal), or in the cervix.

Presentation: Common symptoms of fibroids include pain, pressure, and changes in menstruation. Other related signs may be miscarriages, infertility, or an enlarged uterus, and some may have no symptoms at all. Work loss and quality of life can be issues. The physical exam typically has an enlarged uterus that is freely mobile. The uterus may feel \"knobby\" from an irregular contour, and occasionally be minimally tender on exam.

Management: NSAIDS, combined oral contraceptive pills, levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs, depo-medroxyprogesterone, and a variety of surgical options (e.g., hysterectomy, myomectomy) are among the options.

### Adenomyosis

-   Epidemiology: Occurs more frequently in parous than nonparous people. Adenomyosis actually can be found in any person with a uterus from adolescence to menopause.

-   Pathophysiology: Presence of endometrial glands within the uterine myometrium. Why this happens is not completely understood. One theory is endometrial invagination, but has not been completely proven. It is hypothesized that estrogen and progesterone play a role only because hormones can be treatment options.

-   Presentation:

    -   60% of women complain of menorrhagia. Others may complain of AUB

    -   The uterus is typically enlarged and diffusely boggy, but symmetric and should still be mobile.

    -   There may be some urinary or gastrointestinal symptoms secondary to size and mass effect on the bladder and rectum.

-   Diagnosis

    -   Ultrasound may demonstrate a heterogeneously boggy uterus.

    -   MRI is more specific for diagnosis.

-   Management

    -   There is not currently any surgical method to remove the discrete areas affected.

    -   Hormonal contraception may help with symptoms in those who desire future pregnancy, while uterine artery embolization or hysterectomy may be performed in those no longer desiring biological children.

### Endometriosis

-   Epidemiology: Endometriosis is a disorder that affects people of reproductive age with a uterus. The most common age affected is 25 to 35 years old. The exact prevalence in the general population is unknown. Risk factors include nulliparity, early menarche or late menopause, short menstrual cycles, and long menses. There may be protective factors that decrease the likelihood of endometriosis. These include multiparity, lactating, and late menarche.

-   Pathophysiology: Endometrial glands in areas other than the uterus.

-   Presentation:

    -   Symptoms include dyspareunia, bowel or bladder symptoms that cycle with menses, fatigue, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and some effects on fertility.

    -   Pain, either chronic pelvic pain or dysmenorrhea, occurs in 75% of patients with endometriosis and is the most common symptom.

    -   Dyspareunia is a differentiating clinical factor: it is common in those with endometriosis; it is rare with leiomyoma.

    -   On physical exam these patients have pain in the pain cul-de-sac, immobile and retroflexed uterus, nodules on the uterosacral ligaments, or just pain with uterine motion.

-   Management:

    -   Symptoms may be controlled with methods similar to those for menorrhagia.

    -   Hormonal contraceptives may alleviate symptoms.

    -   Hysterectomy and uterine artery embolization are less likely to be effective as the tissue is outside of the uterus.

### Endometrial Hyperplasia

-   With or without atypia can cause bleeding.

-   Simple hyperplasia progresses to cancer in less than 5% of patients; atypical complex hyperplasia is a premalignant lesion that has a 25% probability of progressing to cancer. Therefore, careful monitoring and treatment is important with this disorder.

### Endometrial cancer

-   The fourth most common cancer in women, and the main diagnosis that must be considered in a woman presenting with postmenopausal bleeding.

-   Also must be considered in women over the age of 35 with symptoms suggestive of anovulatory bleeding (spotting, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia).

-   Ninety percent of patients with endometrial cancer have abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Ovarian Problems
----------------

### Ovarian Cysts

Ovarian cysts commonly cause recurrent and chronic pelvic pain. This type of pain is more likely to occur mid-cycle, although the patient may have pain associated with menses. This location of this pain is typically in one of the lower quadrants and not as much midline. Ovarian cysts may come and go related to ovulation.

### Hormone-producing Ovarian Tumors

-   Rare.

-   Most ovarian cancers do not cause postmenopausal bleeding or other significant symptoms, but postmenopausal bleeding is one of several symptoms associated with a higher risk for ovarian cancer (6.6 fold increased risk).

-   Other possible symptoms of ovarian cancer include pelvic or abdominal pain, increase in abdominal size or bloating, and difficulty eating or feeling full.

Problems with Getting Pregnant
------------------------------

### Menopause

Menopause is a normal process that occurs as the ovaries are depleted of follicles and produce less estrogen. It is thought to be, primarily, the lack of estrogen that leads to the majority of postmenopausal symptoms. This happens in the US at a median age of 51.3 years, between 40 and 58 years of age for most women.

-   Dx:

    -   6 month absence of menses with associated hypoestrogenic symptoms (e.g. hot flashes, atrophic vaginitis, urinary symptoms, dyspareunia, sleep disturbances, mood disturbances, and concentration problems)

    -   Measurement of FSH \>30 U/L (LH increases a later than FSH in menopause and is less sensitive)

-   Tx:

    -   HRT Hormone therapy includes use of estrogen alone or use of estrogen combined with progesterone. It can improve health-related quality of life by improving vasomotor and atrophic symptoms caused by menopause.

        It is NO longer recommended for prevention of endoemtrial cancer risk reduction, coronary heart disease or osteoporosis due to associated risk (e.g. Thromboembolism). The only current indication for HRT is vasomotor symptoms in women age $<$ 60 with few risk factors who have undergone menopause within the past 10 years.\
        Menopausal hormonal therapy, especially when started in the first five years after menopause, helps prevent osteoporosis by maintaining bone density. For many years, HT was used extensively for this purpose. While osteoporosis prevention may be a benefit of HT used to treat menopausal symptoms, it is not recommended as an agent for the purpose of osteoporosis prevention.\
        Risk of HRT

        -   Combined estrogen and progestogen use beyond three years increases the risk of breast cancer.

        -   Use of unopposed systemic estrogen in females with a uterus increases endometrial cancer risk.

        -   Beginning HT after age 60 increases the risk of coronary artery disease.

        -   HT increases the risk of stroke at least for the first one to two years of use.

        -   Increased report of incontinence in woman with HRT

        Therefore, HT for menopausal symptoms should use the lowest effective doses for the shortest possible times.

        -   Bleeding in the first 12 months of HRT can be normal, however bleeding after 12 months of therapy always requires further evaluation.

    -   SSRI for patients with contraindications to HRT such as personal history of CAD, thromboembolism, TIA, stroke, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer.

### Age-related infertility

-   Dx

    -   Day 3 FSH testing to assess ovarian function

-   Tx

    -   Assistive reproductive techniques - in vitro fertilization, oocyte / embryo donation

### Antiphospholipid Syndrome

-   Diagnosis

    -   Vascular thrombosis (TIA, DVT)

    -   OR pregnancy complication (e.g. recurrent miscarriage)

    -   PLUS of the following antibodies

        -   Anti-cardiolipin antibody

        -   Lupus anticoagulant

        -   Anti-beta2-glycoprotein antibody

-   Management:

    -   Heparin to prevent venous thromboembolism during pregnancy

    -   long term treatment with warfarin

-   Associated condition: SLE

### Pseudocyesis

Likely occurs when somatization of stress affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, causes early pregnancy symptoms, or when bodily changes (e.g. weight gain, amenorrhea) are misinterpreted.

-   Risk factor

    -   History of infertility

    -   Prior pregnancy loss

-   Presentation:

    -   nonpsychotic patient who believes that she is pregnant

    -   may misinterprets negative home pregnancy tests as being positive

    -   symptoms of early pregnancy

-   Diagnosis

    -   Negative pregnancy test

    -   U/s reveals a normal empty uterus

-   Management

    -   Psychiatric evaluation and treatment

Non-viable Pregnancies
----------------------

### Hydatidiform Mole

-   Risk factors

    -   Extremes of maternal age

    -   History of hydatidiform mole

-   Presentation

    -   Abnormal vaginal bleeding hydropic tissue; uncontrolled molar tissue proliferation and endometrial blood collection can cause first trimester vaginal bleeding

    -   Uterine enlargement \> gestational age

    -   Abnormally elevated beta-hCG levels

    -   Theca lutein ovarian cysts

    -   Hyperemesis gravidarum

    -   Pre-eclampsia with severe features, especially if \<20 weeks gestation

    -   Hyperthyroidism

-   Diagnosis

    -   Snowstorm appearance on ultrasound / heterogeneous mass of cystic structures

    -   May have theca lutein cysts on U/S, which are large, bilateral, multilocular cysts that occur due to ovarian hyperstimulation

    -   Quantitative serum beta-hCG; marked elevated (\>100, 000 IU/L)

    -   Histologic evaluation of uterine contents

-   Treatment

    -   Uterine evacuation via suction curettage to remove premalignant tissue and prevent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN)

    -   After evacuation, perform serial beta-hCG levels to monitor for GTN

### Gestational Choriocarcinoma

Malignant tumor from trophoblasts, commonly preceded by hydatidiform mole -- can follow abortion, normal pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy. Lungs are the most common location of distal spread.

-   Dx:

    -   Macroscopic: bulky intrauterine mass usually soft and yellow-white with extensive areas of necrosis and hemorrhage

    -   Microscopic: abnormal proliferation of both cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts, no villi

-   Tx: Sensitive to chemotherapy

### Ectopic Pregnancy

Presentation

-   Abdominal Pelvic pain

-   Amenorrhea

-   Vaginal Bleeding

Dx

-   Positive $\beta-hCG$

Treatment

-   Methotrexate - a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, for managing hemodynamically stable ectopic pregnancy.

Complications

-   Ectopic pregnancy cause rupture easily because of compromised blood supply to surrounding tissues

-   Management of Suspected Ectopic Pregnancy: Positive urine hCG lower abdominal pain and /or vaginal bleeding

    -   If hemodynamically unstable: immediate surgical consultation

    -   If hemodynamically stable: do TVUS to find location of pregnancy; if diagnostic, manage pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy accordingly; if non-diagnostic, get serum beta-hCG level. If the level is \<1500 repeat beta-hCG in 2 days, if \>1500 repeat beta-hCG and TVUS in 2 days.

Normal Viable Pregnancy
-----------------------

### Diagnosis of Pregnancy

#### Signs

Classic signs of pregnancy include a delayed menstrual period, symptoms of nausea, breast tenderness, and malaise. Additional classic signs include a bluish discoloration of the cervix from venous congestion (Chadwick's sign), usually visible by eight to 10 weeks gestation, and a palpably gravid uterus, usually easily discerned by 10 to 12 weeks gestation.

#### Studies

L1.5inL0.5inL4in Study & ToD & Remarks\
Home pregnancy test & & reliable, FDA threshold $\geq 50$ mIU/mL, most kits has a detection limit of $\geq 25$ mIU/mL.\
Blood test hCG & 1+ wk & detection limit of 5 mIU/mL, but subjected to false positives at this high sensitivity, and thus should not be used for inital diagnosis, but can be very helpful in determining the viability of a pregnancy since hCG levels rise predictably in early pregnancy.\
Transvaginal U/S & 4-5 wk & A gestational sac can often be visualized by 4-5 weeks' gestation, and a fetal pole is often seen by 5-6 weeks. In women who have irregular periods or have other risk factors, such as vaginal bleeding, TVUS can be a useful tool for dating pregnancy as well as evaluating for ectopic (tubal) pregnancy and other abnormalities.\
Transabdominal U/S &\

### Dating the Pregnancy

Here are the ways to date pregnancy

-   By LMP using Naegle's Rule: Subtract three months, add 7 days

-   Ultrasound:

    -   In cases of an uncertain or unknown last menstrual period (LMP) or size/date discrepancies that arise during the pregnancy, an ultrasound can be used to estimate the gestational age of the fetus.

    -   When used for dating, ultrasound is most accurate during early pregnancy and should be performed as early as possible (and no later than 20 weeks).

    -   Most clinicians will use dates determined by u/s for any discrepancy of

        -   more than one week in the first trimester

        -   more than two weeks in the second trimester

        -   more than three weeks third trimester

        between the ultrasound and another method

-   Fundal height\
    In the third trimester, ultrasound dating is generally no more accurate than dating by estimated fundal height alone. At 20 weeks, the top of the uterine fundus is usually at the level of the umbilicus, and after 20 weeks, it elevates approximately 1 cm above the umbilicus for each week of pregnancy.

A note of caution: gestational age is not the same as the embryonic age (also called conceptional or developmental age) of the embryo, which is calculated from the date of fertilization, or about 2 weeks after the first date of the LMP

### Normal Changes of Pregnancy

$\beta$-hCG produced by human conceptus becomes detectable in maternal serum only after blastocyst successful implants. Implanttion generally occurs on day 6 after ovulation. Generally $\beta$-hCG is detectable in maternal serum about 8 days after ovulation but can take up to 11 days.

L1.25in\|L2.25in\|L2.25in System & Clinical Finding & Mechanism\
Pulmonary & chronic compensated respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation & elevated progesterone directly stimulates central respiratory centers to increase tidal volume and minute ventilation\
Cardiovascular & cardiac output and heart rate & blood volume and systemic vascular resistance\
Heme & dilutional anemia & plasma volume and red blood cell mass\
& prothrombotic state & hormone mediated in total protein S antigen activity; in fibrinogen and coagulation factors\
Renal & Increased GFR and renal size, BUN creatinine & CO and renal blood flow due to progesterone with renal excretion\
& Urinary frequency, nocturia & urine output and sodium excretion\
& Mild hyponatremia & hormones reset threshold to ADH release from pituitary\
MSK & low back pain that can radiate down the thighs, worsen with activity, and improves with rest & Exaggerated lordosis, weakened abdominal muscles, and joint/ligament laxity\
Skin & Melasma - bilateral symmetric irregularly shaped macules on sun exposed area & estrogen and progesterone, in addition to UV, triggers melanocyte proliferation\

Updated Definitions of Diseases in Pregnancy

-   Anemia in pregnancy is redefined as \<11 g/dL in 1st and 3rd trimester and \<10.5 g/dL in second.

Regular Prenatal Care
---------------------

### First Prenatal Visit

-   History

    -   Assess maternal health

        -   Medical; looking out for HTN, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, autoimmune, endocrine, or neurologic disorders, as well as infections.

        -   Psychiatric: mood disorders

        -   Obstetric: menstrual history, previous pregnancies (number, miscarriages, abortions, delivery method (vaginal or cesarean), infant weight, and any pregnancy or delivery complications)

        -   Preparation for pregnancy this time: taking prenatal vitamins

        -   Family history

            -   blood disorders (i.e., thalassemia in persons of Italian, Greek, Mediterranean or Asian descent; sickle cell disease or trait, especially in those of African descent; hemophilia),

            -   neural tube defects (meningomyelocele, spina bifida, anencephaly)

            -   congenital heart defects

            -   Down's syndrome, Tay-Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, intellectual disability, metabolic disorders, or other inherited genetic or chromosomal disorders.

        -   Social history

            -   assessment of specific environmental risk factors: chemical exposure (lead), stress

            -   relationship: people, pets, working

            -   lifestyle: alcohol, smoking, drugs, activity,

-   Initial Labs

    -   Rh(D) type and antibody screen

    -   Hemoglobin/hematocrit, MCV,

    -   HIV, VDRL/RPR, HBsAg, Chlamydia PCR

    -   Rubella and varicella immunity

    -   Urine culture and protein

    -   Pap test (if eligible and no previous screening)

    -   Hepatitis C antibody screen (if high risk - prison inmates, intravenous drug use, HIV-positive, multiple sexual partners, tattoos, or elevated liver enzymes)

    -   Herpes I/II antibodies: All patients should be asked about a history of genital and orolabial herpes simplex virus infection; women who do not have a history of herpes should be counseled about avoiding exposure during pregnancy. Women with a history of recurrent HSV should be counseled about the use of antiviral medicine (such as acyclovir) to reduce risk of cesarean delivery due to active lesions at the time of delivery (the presence of active lesions during labor is a contraindication for vaginal delivery).

-   Provide recommendations to mother

    -   Expected changes

        -   Expected weight gain

        -   Other symptoms of pregnancy: nausea, fatigue, and breast tenderness initially, aches and pain later on.

    -   Alcohol and drugs

    -   Minimize / quite smoking

    -   Working conditions\
        Some working conditions, such as prolonged standing and exposure to certain chemicals, are associated with pregnancy complications.

    -   Exercise\
        Pregnant women should avoid activities that put them at risk for falls or abdominal injuries. At least 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days of the week is a reasonable activity level for most pregnant women.

    -   Sex\
        Sexual intercourse during pregnancy is not associated with adverse outcomes.

    -   Hot tubs\
        Hot tubs and saunas should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy. Maternal heat exposure during pregnancy has been associated with neural tube defects and miscarriage.

    -   Medications and Herbal Remedies\
        Eat a healthy diet with a variety of foods, including protein (meat, dairy), fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

        Take daily prenatal vitamin, which provides the recommended folic acid (0.4 to 0.8 mg per day) and iron (30 mg per day) for pregnant women.

        Avoid raw eggs, unpasteurized milk or milk products, soft cheeses (such as feta, brie, veined, Camembert, and Mexican queso fresco), unwashed fruits or vegetables, raw fish, shellfish, and large, steak-like fish (such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish).

    -   Nutrition, dietary supplement, and food safety

-   Plan for follow up

    -   Every 4 weeks until 28 weeks

    -   Every 2 weeks from 18 - 36 weeks

    -   Every week from 36 weeks

-   Provide call-in number

### Regular Follow-up Visits

Always check for

1.  Weight; given the recommended weight gain as follows

      Category        BMI           Recommended Weight Gain
      --------------- ------------- -------------------------
      Normal weight   18.5 - 24.9   25 - 35 lbs
      Overweight      25 - 29.9     15 - 25 lbs
      Obese           $>30$         11 -20 lbs

2.  Blood Pressure

3.  Fetal Heart Tones (starting 10 - 12 wks)

4.  Fundus height (after 20 weeks)

Immunization

-   Pregnant women are at increased risk for complications from influenza, so the influenza vaccine is recommended for all pregnant women. The intramuscular preparation of the vaccine is an inactivated vaccine and is safe to give at any time during pregnancy.

-   Note: FluMist or other live-attenuated virus preparations are not recommended during pregnancy.

-   The tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (TDaP) vaccine is recommended for all pregnant women, irrespective of when they last received this vaccine, between 27 and 36 weeks.

-   Rubella immunization needs to be given to prevent maternal rubella infection during a future pregnancy; however, as a live vaccine, it not safe to give until after completion of a current pregnancy. It is often given in the hospital after delivery and before the mother goes home.

#### 12 - 16 wk

-   All pregnant women should also be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria with a urine culture. The recommended time would be between week 12 and 16 of gestation.

-   Initiate discussion about the \"triple\" or \"quad\" screening

    -   Triple Screen: AFP, hCG, unconjugated estriol levels

    -   Quad screen: add dimeric inhibin

    Here is the pathological basis of these markers

    -   AFP is synthesized by fetal liver, GI tract, yolk-sac, and maternal serum AFP increases with gestation age; Most common cause of elevated AFP is dating error, always bear this in mind!

    -   hCG is synthesized by trophoblastic tissue

    -   Estriol level reflect placental and fetal function

    The sensitivity of a Quad Screen for Down Syndrome is 80% and the false positive rate is 5%. In contrast, the sensivity of a triple screen is only 70%.

-   Consider nuchal translucency measurement during the first U/S to screen for NTD.

#### 16 - 21 wk

-   Conduct \"triple\" or \"quad\" screening

      Condition     AFP   hCG   estriol   inhibin
      ------------- ----- ----- --------- ---------
      NTD                                 
      Trisomny 21                         
      Trisomny 18                         

    Abnormal triple test is an indication for fetal ultrasonography (USG). If fetal USG reveal level of development consistent with the reported date and no anatomic abnormalities are seen, amniocentesis is performed (or chorionic vilus sampling in first trimester)

-   Other conditions for elevated markers

    -   AFP: abdominal wall defect

    -   hCG: Increased level a/w multiple gestation, hyatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma

    -   Estriol: decreased in placental insufficiency

Other things to do, if the test result were abnormal

-   Double-check that the correct gestational age was recorded by the laboratory

-   Schedule ultrasounds for evaluation of fetal anatomy

-   Offer referral for genetic counselling and amniocentesis

-   Offer follow-up as needed for patient to talk about any concerns that come up after her visit today.

#### 18 - 20 wk

-   Routine U/S for dating and screening for structural anomalies

-   Provide anticipatory guidance on

    -   Breast feeding

    -   Car seats

    -   Contraception post-partum

#### 24 - 28 weeks

-   Hemoglobin/hematocrit

-   Antibody screen if Rh(D) negative

-   50g 1 hr glucose tolerance test

-   U/S cervical length for patients with prior spontaneous preterm birth

-   If indicated, it is recommended that routine Rhogam immunization be given at 28 weeks' gestation and within 72 hours after delivery as well as with any episodes of vaginal or intrauterine bleeding.

#### 30 weeks

#### 32 weeks

-   Patients with gestational HTN starts weekly BPP

#### 34 weeks

#### 36 weeks

-   GBS culture - vaginal-rectal swab

-   Prior HSV infection means to initiate antiviral suppression beginning at 36 weeks; if lesions / prodromal symptoms develop during labor, go for cesarean.

Provide anticipatory guidance on birth and delivery

-   

#### 37 week

-   Consider external cephalic version if malpresentation.

#### 38 week

#### 39 week

#### 40 week

#### 41 weeks - late term pregnancy

#### 42 weeks - post-term pregnancy

-   Fetus need to be delivered before 43 weeks!

### Pregnancy monitoring methods

#### Non-stress test

-   Fetal sleep cycle can be associated with non-reactive non-stress test

#### Reading the Tocometer

#### Contraction Strength Measurement

Adequate contraction is defined as Montevideo units as measured by intrauterine pressure catheter. Increasing strength above 200 Montevideo units will not change labor curve.

High Risk Pregnancies
---------------------

### Advanced maternal age

Age of mother \>35 y/o is associated with

-   Protracted labor course

-   Increased likelihood of trisomny 21

### Short Interpregnancy Interval

During pregnancy, maternal folate and iron are depleted for fetal development and resulting maternal anemia is exacerbated by normal blood loss during delivery. In breastfeeding women, continued nutritional demands from the newborn prevent repletion of normal folate and iron stores, resulting in prolonged anemia. Due to these increased demands, women with short interpregnancy intervals (\<6 - 18 months between delivery and next pregnancy) have an increased risk of pregnancy complications including

-   Maternal anemia

-   Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes - possibly due to persistent genital tract inflammation

-   Preterm labor

-   Low birthweight

### Twin Pregnancy

-   Maternal complications to consider

    -   Hyperemesis gravidarum

    -   Gestational diabetes mellitus

    -   Iron-deficiency anemia

    -   Pre-eclampsia

-   Fetal complications to consider

    -   Congenital abnormalities

    -   Fetal growth restriction

    -   Preterm delivery

    -   Malpresentation

    -   Twin-twin transfusion syndrome - if monochorionic

    -   Conjoined or cord entanglement - if monoamniotic

  --------------- ----------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Separation      0 - 4 day   Monozygotic twins with 2 placentas, 2 amnions
                              Lambda sign at intertwin membrane
                  4- 8 days   Monozygotic twins with 1 placenta, 2 amniotic sac
                              T-sign at intertwin membrane
  Late division   8 -12 day   Monozygotic twins with 1 chorionic and 1 amniotic sac
  Very late       \>13 day    Monoamniotic monochorionic conjoined twins
  --------------- ----------- -------------------------------------------------------

### Late / Post Term pregnancies

Late term pregnancy is defined as weeks gestation and post-term pregnancy is defined as weeks gestation.

-   Risk Factors

-   Complications

    -   Fetal: macrosomnia, dysmaturity syndrome, oligohydramnios, demise

    -   Maternal: severe obstetric laceration, cesarean, postpartum hemorrhage

-   Management

    -   Frequent fetal monitoring

    -   Delivery prior to 43 weeks gestation

Maternal Pregnancy Complications
--------------------------------

### Morning Sickness

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is usually self-limited, beginning between the fourth and seventh week and resolving by the 20th week in most women.

Dietary measures for managing morning sickness

-   Eat frequent, small meals, avoid smells and food textures that cause nausea.

-   Solid foods should be bland tasting, high in carbohydrates, and low in fat.

-   Salty foods usually can be tolerated early in the morning, and sour and tart liquids often are tolerated better than water.

Emotional support is needed

-   Lend a compassionate ear and ensure that the patient has enough support at home, as morning sickness, while usually benign, is quite upsetting to many newly pregnant women.

Additional measures

-   Acupressure

-   Dietary supplements

    -   ginger power 1 g per day

    -   Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) 25 mg every 8 hours

    -   Doxylamine, 25 mg at bedtime

-   Antiemetics

    -   Prochlorperazine, 25 mg per rectum every 12 hours

    -   Promethazine, 25 mg orally or rectally every 4 hours

    -   Ondansetron, 8 mg two or three times daily

-   Antihistamine

    -   Diphenhydramine, 25-50 mg every 4 to 8 hours

-   Motility Agents

    -   Metoclopramide, 5-10 mg three times daily.

### Hyperemesis Gravidarum

-   Risk factors

    -   Hydatidiform mole

    -   Multifetal gestation

    -   History of HG, and GERD

-   Presentation

    -   Severe persistent nausea and vomiting

    -   Weight loss (\>5% prepregnancy weight)

    -   Signs of dehydration

-   Diagnosis: Differentiate from typical N/V of pregnancy

    -   Ketonuria

    -   Hypochloremis metabolic alkalosis

    -   Hypokalemia

    -   Hemoconcentration

    -   Elevaed serum aminotransferases

    -   Marked elevation of $\beta$-hCG

-   Treatment

    -   Hospital admissions for IV antiemetics, rehydration, and electrolyte repletion.

    -   May consider total parenteral nutrition

    -   May also consider systemic corticosteroids.

### Gestational Diabetes

-   Screening:

    -   early pregnancy for high risk patients: obesity, previous GDM, previous macrosomnic infant

    -   24 - 28 week for everyone

-   Risks associated with gestiational DM

    -   preeclampsia

    -   fetal macrosomia (large babies who also may have a disproportionately large trunk to head ratio, increasing risks for shoulder dystocia in labor)

    -   birth trauma

    -   need for operative delivery

    -   neonatal mortality

    -   newborn complications (hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypocalcemia, and others)

-   Diagnosis\
    The three-hour glucose tolerance test is performed by measuring the patient's glucose after fasting and then one, two, and three hours after ingesting a 100-gram glucose load, usually in the form of a solution that the patient drinks. Two sets of criteria can be used to define an abnormal three-hour glucose tolerance test.

      Criteria                     Fasting   1 hr   2 hr   3 hr

        -   2-hour postprandial mg/dl

    -   1st line: dietary modifications

    -   2nd line: insulin, metformin

### Hyperandrogenism in Pregnancy

Gestational hyperandrogenism arises from either maternal or fetal sources that result in maternal and possible fetal virilization.

L1.25in\|L1inL2inL1.5in & Ovarian Mass & Virilization Risk & Resolution\
Placental aromatase deficiency & No mass & Maternal high, fetal high & Spontaneous\
Luteoma & Solid, unilateral / bilateral & Maternal moderate, fetal high & Spontaneous\
Theca Lutein Cyst & Cystic, bilateral & Maternal moderate, fetal low & Spontaneous\
Sertoli-Leydig tumor & Solid, unilateral & Maternal high, fetal high & Surgery in 2nd trimester or postpartum.\

### Degenerating Uterine Leiomyoma

Leiomyomata uteri are benign myometrial tumors that can grow rapidly during pregnancy due to elevated estrogen and progesterone levels. However, because myometrial blood flow shifts towards the developing fetus and placenta during pregnancy, *fibroids can outgrow their blood supply leading to fibroid infarction and necrosis.*

-   Presentation

    -   Acute-onset abdominal pain

    -   Fundal tenderness, firm tender mass, and leukocytosis due to inflammatory cytokine release

    -   Uterine contractions due to prostaglandin release

-   Diagnosis: confirmation by U/S

-   Management:

    -   Conservative with acute pain control e.g. indomethacin in patients \<32 weeks gestation

### Gestational Hypertension

This is distinguished from chronic HTN by a late onset after 20th week of pregnancy. Gestational HTN also typically resolve after delivery, while chronic HTN persist after 2 weeks postpartum.

-   Diagnosis\

    -   The presence of persistent systolic blood pressure of $\geq$140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure of $\geq$ 90 mmHg

    -   without proteinuria

    -   in a previously normotensive pregnant woman at or after 20 weeks of gestation.

-   Treatment

    -   Labetalol

    -   Weekly BPP starting at 32 weeks

### Pre-eclampsia and Associated Conditions

Preeclampsia is a leading cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of preeclampsia likely involves abnormal placental development and function, which puts fetus at risk for chronic uteroplacental insufficiency. The risk of developing preeclampsia in a woman with elevated blood pressure first measured at \< 30 weeks gestation has been estimated at 42%, and when first detected at or after 36 weeks has been estimated at 10%.\
African American women are more likely to have preeclampsia than other women (Asian, Hispanic, or Caucasian) in the US, their disease is more likely to be severe, and they are also more likely to suffer the complications of preeclampsia, such as placental abruption and eclampsia. The underlying causes for these differences are multifaceted and include a host of socio-structural factors such as access to healthcare, health education, and environmental stressors.

-   Presentation of pre-eclampsia

    -   After 20 weeks of pregnancy

    -   Triad of HTN, proteinuria, and edema

    -   If severe: Visual disturbances, severe headache, right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, decreased urine output

-   Diagnosis of Preclampsia

    -   HTN: blood pressure of greater than $\geq$140 mmHg systolic and/or $\geq$ 90 mmHg diastolic on at least two readings (greater than six hours apart ideally) in a seated or semi-reclined position in a woman who previously had normal blood pressures and is over 20 week gestation (by itself, this is the definition of Gestational Hypertension)

    -   24 hour urine protein collection - proteinuria of 300 mg or more, a urine protein/creatinine ratio of , OR at least 1$+$ or 30 mg/dL on dipstick (again, on two occasions ideally six hours apart)

    -   Severe features

        -   severe hypertension of at least 160 mmHg systolic or 110 mmHg diastolic (two readings at least four hours apart)

        -   right upper quadrant pain or a doubling of serum transaminases

        -   platelet count \< 100 K/ mL

        -   creatinine of \> 1.1 mg/dL or doubling of creatinine

        -   pulmonary edema

        -   new and persistent cerebral or visual disturbances

-   Associated conditions

    -   Ecclampsia: pre-eclampsia with seizures

    -   HELLP syndrome - a variant of severe preclampsia and affects 10 - 20% of women with preeclampsia:

        -   elevated liver enzymes due to centrilobular necrosis,

        -   low platelets and hemolytic anemia following hematoma formation and thrombi in the portal capillary system.

        These processes can cause liver swelling with distension of the hepatic (Glisson's) capsule, resulting in right upper quadrant or epigastric pain.

-   Complications

    -   Fetal: growth restriction / low birth weight

    -   Maternal: abruptio placentae, disseminsted intravascular coagulation, eclampsia, acute pulmonary edema

        Preeclampsia patients have generalized arterial vasospasm leading to increased systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac afterload. The heart becomes hyperdynamic to try to overcome the systemic hypertension. Additional factors that may contribute to pulmonary edema include decreased renal function, decreased serum albumin, and endothelial damage leading to increased capillary permeability.

        Manage pulmomary edema with supplemental oxygen, fluid restriction, and cautious diuresis.

-   Management

    -   Gestational HTN only: Low dose aspirin in high risk patients should be initiated at 12 - 28 weeks and ideally before 16 weeks and continued daily until delivery - inhibits platelet aggregation and helps prevent placental ischemia;

    -   Pre-clampsia without severe features: Twice-weekly non-stress testing combined with assessment of amniotic fluid volume (or twice-weekly biophysical profiles) is part of the management of preeclampsia without severe features.

    -   Pre-clampsia with severe features: expedited delivery

### Skin Rashes

Here are common skin eruptions in pregnancy

-   pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP): papulovesicular lesions on the trunk and extremities

-   prurigo of pregnancy: generally appears as excoriated areas on the trunk or limbs

-   pruritic folliculitis: rash may be centered around hair follicles and have an associated pustular appearance

The primary treatment goal is generally relief of symptoms, which can be ameliorated by topical emollients and glucocorticoids. Generally, oral steroids are not needed. Antihistamines can also be helpful, but also cause sedation.

It is important to distinguish these conditions from others that may be due to underlying disease, such as cholestasis of pregnancy. In the latter, women usually develop severe, whole-body itching with secondary skin changes due to scratching. Cholestasis is one of the only pruritic conditions that does not have a primary skin manifestation. If suspected, work-up, including serum bile acids, may be indicated. Other conditions that may appear during pregnancy include pustular psoriasis and pemphigoid gestationis.

### Cholelithiasis in Pregnancy

Pregnancy (and use of OCP) predisposes patients to gallstone formation; 5 -12% of women develop gallstone during pregnancy. This is because

-   Estrogen: increase cholesterol synthesis by upregulating hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity so that bile become supersaturated with cholesterol

-   Progesterone: reduces bile acid secretion and slows gallbladder emptying

### Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy

-   Presentation

    -   Develop in third trimester

    -   Generalized pruritus, which can be worse on hands and feet

    -   No associated rash

    -   Right upper quadrant pain

-   Lab abnormalities

    -   Increased total bile acids (\>10 umol/L)

    -   Increased transaminases (\<2x normal)

    -   Increased total and direct bilirubin

-   Obstetric risks -due to transplacental passage of bile acids

    -   Intrauterine fetal demise

    -   Preterm labor

    -   Meconium-stained amniotic fluid

    -   Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome

-   Management

    -   Ursodeoxycholic acid

    -   Regular fetal assessment and delivery at 37 weeks gestation, especially if total bile acid is umol/L.

    -   Antihistamine

### Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy

-   Clinical

    -   Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and significant elevations of liver markers in the third trimester

    -   Extrahepatic complications: leukocytosis, hypoglycemia, acute kidney injury

    -   Unlike HELLP, may not have HTN.

Pregnancy Complications - Placenta Development
----------------------------------------------

### Placenta Previa

Placenta covering the cervix which can lead to excessive bleeding at or prior to delivery, jeopardizing the health of the fetus. While bleeding from placenta previa can occur at any time, bleeding more often occurs later in pregnancy, either late in the second or in the third trimester.

-   Risk Factor

    -   Prior placenta previa

    -   Prior pregnancy and especially if the pregnancy was multi-gestational

    -   Old mother (\> 35 year old) who smoke

    -   Prior cesarean delivery or other uterine surgery

-   Presentation

    -   **Painless** vaginal bleeding \>20 weeks gestation - placenta is sheared off the cervix creating a partial detachment due to uterine irritability (e.g. irregular, nonpainful contractions) which causes physiologic cervical changes (e.g. effacement dilation).

    -   Blood loss is persistent and heavy

    -   Signs of maternal hemorrhagic shock is typically present before severe fetal compromise

    -   Or commonly diagnosed in asymptomatic patients during a second trimester ultrasound

-   Diagnosis

    -   Transabdominal followed by transvaginal sonogram

    -   Placenta previa found on routine second trimester U/S usually resolve on their own. Those located near the os (marginal) or partially covering the os are more likely to resolve.

    -   Early in disease process, bleeding is primarily maternal in origin, therefore a reactive fetal heart tracing is usually seen. However continued maternal blood loss can eventually lead to fetal compromise, with deterioration of the fetal heart rate tracing.

-   Management - depend on hemodynamic stability and fetal status

    -   Subsequent ultrasound surveillance is indicated in women who have placenta previa to document progression or resolution.

    -   No intercourse

    -   No digital cervical examination

    -   Inpatient admission for bleeding episodes

    -   Placenta previa usually resolves by third trimester, if not cesarean is indicated at 36 - 37 weeks gestation

Pregnancy Complications - Labor and Abortions
---------------------------------------------

### Spontaneous Abortion

A spontaneous abortion is defined as unprovoked pregnancy loss at \<20 weeks gestation and is a common cause of first trimester bleeding. They are mostly commonly the result of

-   Fetal chromosomal abnormalities

-   Congenital anomalies

-   Mullerian anomalies

Spontaneous abortions are categorized based on cervical dilation and location of the POC in relation to cervix:

                            Missed    Threatened   Inevitable   Incomplete    Complete
  ------------------------ --------- ------------ ------------ ------------- ----------
      Vaginal Bleeding        No         Yes          Yes           Yes         Yes
        Cervical OS         closed      closed      dilated       dilated      closed
   Fetus cardiac activity     No         Yes           no           no           no
            POC             present    present      present     some remain   expelled

-   Management

    -   Expectant

    -   Medical: misoprostol - synthetic prostaglandin injection; to induce uterine contraction and expulsion of retained POC

    -   Surgical: suction curettage for hemodynamically unstable patients or if there is signs of infection

    -   Rho(D) negative patients require immunoglobulin to prevent isoimmunization

### Induced Abortion

-   Management

    -   Vaginal misoprostol - medical termination of an intrauterine pregnancy by causing cervical dilation and uterine contractions

    -   Intramuscular methotrexate - medical treatment of ectopic pregnancies

### Septic Abortion

This is a medical emergency!

-   Risk factor

    -   Retained POC from elective abortion with nonsterile technqiue, or missed or incomplete abortion (rare)

-   Clinical presentation

    -   Fever, chills, abdominal pain

    -   Sanguinopurulent vaginal discharge

    -   Boggy, tender uterus, dilated cervix

    -   Pelvic ultrasound, retained POC, thick endometrial stripe

-   Management

    -   Intravenous fluids

    -   Broad-spectrum antibiotics

    -   Suction curettage

    -   If no improvement suction curettage and 48 hours of antibiotics, hysterectomy.

-   Complication: peritonitis, septic shock, and death

### Spontaneous Preterm Labor

-   Management

    -   $<$32 weeks, give indomethacin for tocolysis.

    -   Intramuscular hydroxyprogesterone for patients in future deliveries to decrease the risk of recurrence

    -   If due to cervical insufficiency, also consider a cervical cerclage placement in future pregnancies. Cervical cerclage is also used in patients who have short cervix (\<2.5 cm) on U/S

### Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes PPROM

Membrane rupture at \<37 weeks prior to labor onset.

-   Risk factors

    -   Prior PPROM

    -   Genitourinary infection (e.g. ASB,BV)

    -   Antepartum bleeding

-   Presentation: increased vaginal discharge

-   Dx

    -   Vaginal pooling or fluid from cervix

    -   Nitrazine-positive fluid

    -   Ferning on microscopy

-   Management

    -   \<34 weeks (reassuring): latency antibiotics, corticosteroids

    -   \<34 weeks (nonreassuring): delivery

    -   weeks: delivery

-   Complications

    -   Placental abruption

    -   Preterm labor

    -   Chorioambnioitis

    -   Umbilical cord prolapse

### Labor Dystocia

Definition

-   The average speed of dilation is about 2 cm/hour for multiparous women and about 1 cm/hour for primiparous women, so the average length of the active phase of the first stage of labor is 2.4 hours for multiparous women and 4.6 hours for primiparous women.

-   Classically, failure to progress (or active phase arrest) occurs if there is no cervical change for two hours in the active phase of labor. However, more recent data suggestions that waiting four hours for cervical change with adequate contractions and six hours without adequate contractions is safe as long as assessments of mother and fetus are reassuring. This approach decreases the risk of an unnecessary cesarean delivery.

Diagnosis

-   A labor curve is often used to plot the labor progress in terms of cervical dilation, effacement, and fetal descent in order to help diagnosis labor dystocia.

-   You may also diagnose this condition in the second stage of labor if the fetal presenting part does not descend significantly in the pelvis after two hours of pushing (or three hours with an epidural), adding an hour for each for primiparous women.

Treatment

-   administration of IV oxytocin

-   artificial rupture of membranes.

### Chorioamnionitis

-   Risk factors

    -   Prolonged rupture of membranes (\>18 hours)

    -   Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes

    -   Prolonged labor

    -   Internal fetal/uterine monitoring devices

    -   Repetitive vaginal examinations

    -   Presence of genital tract pathogens

-   Diagnosis: Maternal fever PLUS of the following

    -   Fetal tachycardia (\>160 bpm)

    -   Maternal leukocytosis

    -   Purulent amniotic fluid

-   Management: regardless of gestational age

    -   Broad-spectrum antibiotics

    -   Delivery

-   Complications

    -   Maternal: postpartum hemorrhage, endometritis

    -   Fetal: preterm birth, pneumonia, encephalopathy

Iatrogenic Conditions
---------------------

### Teratogenic Medicines to Avoid

L1in\|L4.75in Teratogen & Risk\
Valproate & increase the risk for NTD due to inhibition of folic acid absorption\
Lithium & Ebstein's anomaly\
Vitamin A & Craniofacial abnormalities, posterior fossa CNS defects, auditory defects, abnormalities of great vessels similar to DiGeorge Syndrome\

#### Oxytocin-induced Hyponatremia

Oxytocin, commonly used for induction of labor and postpartum hemorrhage management has a similar structure to ADH. Therefore, elevated levels can stimulate renal collecting ducts to increase free water absorption, leading to acute hyponatremia

-   Presentation

    -   Generalized tonic-clonic seizure after induction of labor

    -   Excessive or prolonged oxytocin administration

-   Diagnosis

    -   Hyponatremia

-   Management

    -   Cessation of oxytocin infusion

    -   Gradual administration of hypertonic saline (3% saline) in symptomatic patients to raise serum osmolality and reverse cerebral edema.

### Magnesium Toxocity

Magnesium is the treatment of choice for the prevention of eclamptic seizures, it is also administered to patients for whom preterm delivery is imminent as it decreases risk for cerebral palsy in premature infants.

-   Common adverse effect of magnesium sulfate

    -   Headache

    -   Nausea

    -   Fatigue

    -   Diaphoresis

-   Signs of toxicity

    -   Affect skeletal muscle Loss of deep tendon reflex, muscle weakness, respiratory depression

    -   Affect cardiac muscle prolonged conduction time and cardiac arrest

    -   Somnolence

-   Risk factors for toxicity

    -   Renal insufficiency - magnesium is excreted by the kidneys

-   Management

    -   Patients with elevated serum creatinine may need a lower magnesium dose and close observation

    -   Magnesium levels should be checked after initiation of infusion and infusion rate adjusted accordingly

    -   If there is signs of toxicity, stop infusion

    -   Use IV Calcium Gluconate bolus to treat

Post-partum Care
----------------

### Contraception

Progestin-only pills, injectable progestin (Depo-Provera), and progestin implants (Nexplanon) can be started immediately postpartum. Advantages to these methods include the minimal effect of progestins on blood pressure, coagulation factors or lipid levels, and the lack of increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, or venous thromboembolism with progestin-only contraceptives. Potential disadvantages include the need to take a daily pill at the same time every day (for maximum effectiveness) with a progestin-only pill and irregular bleeding, particularly within the first few months.

In women who are breastfeeding, progestins do not appear to cause changes in the composition or volume of breast milk or have any negative effect on the infant. Systematic reviews have shown progestin-only contraceptives have no significant effect on milk composition or infant growth when initiated immediately postpartum.

Copper-containing and levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs are approved for use postpartum and may be inserted immediately after delivery of the placenta. Immediate insertion has been shown to be safe and effective, although earlier insertion has a slightly higher expulsion rate compared to insertion at four to six weeks postpartum.

Use of combined oral contraceptives postpartum and in lactating women is controversial. According to CDC guidelines, combination oral contraceptives are considered inappropriate in the first 21 days after delivery because of the increased risk of deep vein thrombosis. Although evidence is limited, it suggests that the harms outweigh the benefit in breastfeeding after the initial postpartum period. Women may benefit from reduced coagulation-related risks (such as DVT) by waiting four or more weeks postpartum, and combined oral contraceptives are known to suppress milk production in the early postpartum period. However, clinical trials have shown mixed results with regard to the effect of combined oral contraceptives on milk supply and infant growth, and a Cochrane review concluded that no evidence-based recommendation can be made about the use of combined oral contraceptives in lactating women.

### Postpartum Depression

Postpartum blues typically last about two weeks after delivery. Longer lasting or more severe symptoms raise a concern of postpartum depression.

Postpartum blues refers to mild, though often rapid, fluctuations in mood within the first two weeks postpartum, often peaking at about day five. Multiple factors likely contribute to postpartum blues. They usually resolve over time with support, reassurance, and rest. Women with postpartum blues should be counseled about seeking care if symptoms worsen or are not improved by two-weeks postpartum.

Postpartum depression occurs in about 15% of women and refers to the onset of clinical depression (using the same criteria as for those who are non-pregnant) within the first four weeks postpartum. In clinical practice, onset within the first year after delivery of an infant is often referred to as postpartum depression. Multiple risk factors have been associated with postpartum depression. Some of these include stressful life events over the preceding year; unplanned pregnancy; lack of spousal or partner support; personal history of mental disorders; and, especially relevant in this case, having an infant with a congenital malformation.
