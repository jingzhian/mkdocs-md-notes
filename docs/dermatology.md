### Describing a skin lesion

Definitions

-   Primary Skin Lesions: uncomplicated lesions that represent initial pathologic change, uninfluenced by secondary alterations such as infection, trauma, and surgery

-   Secondary Skin Leisions: changes that occur as consequences of progression of the disease, scratching, or infection of primary lesions

Descriptions of primary skin lesions

L1in\|L4in Macule & A macule is a change in the color of the skin. It is flat, and if you were to close your eyes and run your fingers over the surface of a purely macular lesion, you could not detect it. It is less than 1 cm in diameter. Some authors use 5 mm for size criterion. Sometimes \"macule\" is used for flat lesion of any size.\
Patch & A patch is a macule greater than 1 cm in diameter.\
Papule & A papule is a solid raised lesion that has distinct borders and is less than 1 cm in diameter.\
Plaque & A plaque is a solid, raised, flat-topped lesion greater than 1 cm in diameter. It is analogous to the geological formation, the plateau.\
Nodule & A nodule is a raised solid lesion and may be in the epidermis, dermis or subcutaneous tissue.\
Tumor & A tumor is a solid mass of the skin or subcutaneous tissue; it is larger than a nodule.\
Vesicle & A vesicle is a raised lesion less than 1 cm in diameter and is filled with clear fluid.\
Bulla & A bulla is a circumscribed fluid filled lesion that is greater than 1 cm in diameter.\
Wheal & A wheal is an area of elevated edema in the upper epidermis.\
Pustule & A pustule is a circumscribed elevated lesion that contains pus.\

### History taking for dermatology

-   How long have you had the lesion?

-   Have you hurt your arm where the lesion is?

-   Is it itchy and is it painful?

-   Is there history of sun exposure?

### Physical Exam for dermatology

#### Distribution

The distribution of the skin lesions is important in diagnosing skin diseases. Many conditions have typical patterns or affect specific regions of the body.

-   Extensor surface: psoriasis

-   Flexor surface: atopic eczema

-   Palms and soles: erythema multiforme, secondary syphilis and eczema.

#### Shape

Descriptions like oval, round, linear etc. can be used to describe the shape of the lesions. Annular lesions are circular with normal skin in the center.

-   Annular macules: drug eruptions, secondary syphilis and lupus erythematosus

-   Iris lesions: lyme's disease\
    Iris lesions are a special type of annular lesion in which an erythematous annular macule or papule develops a second ring or a purplish papule or vesicle in the center (target or bull's eye lesion).

#### Arrangement

-   Contact dermatitis: A linear arrangement of lesions may indicate a contact reaction to an exogenous substance brushing across the skin.

-   Zosterform: refers to lesions arranged along the cutaneous distribution of a spinal nerve.

#### Size

It is important to measure some lesions, especially nevi and skin malignancies like squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin greater than 2 cm in diameter is regarded to be high risk for recurrence and metastasis. Nevi larger than 6 mm in diameter are more likely to be malignant than smaller nevi.

#### Associated symptoms

Associated symptoms, like itching, pain, or burning sensation are helpful to make a diagnosis of certain skin diseases. Eczema tends to be itchy compared to fungal skin infections. Pain is usually associated with herpes simplex or herpes zoster.

#### Skin Cancer Detection - ABCDE

-   Asymmetry: Asymmetry in two or more axes.

-   Border: Irregular border.

-   Color: Two or more colors.

-   Diameter: Six millimeters or greater.

-   Enlargement: Enlargement of the surface of the lesion. (Some references refer to alternate E's: evolution or elevation)

When a hyperpigmented skin lesion shows asymmetry, irregular borders, mixed colors, a diameter of six millimeters or larger, or recent growth in size, your suspicion of melanoma becomes higher.

### Skin Biopsy

L1.25in\|L2.25in\|L2.5in Type of biopsy & Procedure & Tool and specimen size\
Incisional / punch biopsy & Incisional biopsy means taking out a part of the skin lesion, while punch biopsy is a specific incisional biopsy using a cylindrical dermal biopsy tool. & Disposable punches are very convenient and available from two to eight millimeters in size.A full thickness of skin can easily be obtained with a punch biopsy. If a lesion is less than three millimeters in size, it does not need stitches after biopsy.\
Excisional biopsy & Excisional biopsy involves removing the whole lesion with a two to three millimeter margin, depending on the nature of the lesion. & Larger-sized punches may be useful for excisional punch biopsies. This is the diagnostic method of choice if there is a strong suspicion of malignant melanoma.\
Shave biopsy & Shave biopsy is feasible when the lesion is elevated above the surface. & Some experts occasionally elevate the lesion with lidocaine and shave in certain circumstances in order to avoid stitches.\

The risk with this procedure is that obviously you will have a scar after the procedure. There is also a small chance of bleeding and infection, even though we do our best to prevent these things. After the procedure, Steri-Strip may fall off after a few days. If patient sees that the wound is red about six to seven days after the procedure, or sees pus coming out, (signs of delayed healing or infection) he should contact Dr without delay. Finally teach patient how to manage possible bleeding and schedule a follow up in a week or so.

### Skin Lesion Therapy

L1in\|L2.5in\|L2.5in Therapy & Conditions treated & More details\
Mohs microscopic surgery & Patients with any nonmelanoma skin cancer greater than two centimeters, lesions with indistinct margins, recurrent lesions, and those close to important structures, including the eyes, nose, and mouth, should be considered for referral for complete excision via Mohs micrographic surgery, with possible plastic repair. & The surgeon can immediately review the pathology to confirm complete excision during a staged excision. Since this allows removal of the least necessary amount of tissue, this procedure is indicated in cosmetically sensitive areas. This ability to immediately confirm pathology is also useful in lesions with indistinct margins where more tissue than clinically apparent may require removal. If a difficult repair is anticipated or a poor cosmetic result is expected, referral is appropriate.\
Surgical excision & Most widely used treatment for cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas (SCCs), particularly high risk lesions. & Well defined, small (\< 2 centimeters) SCC lacking any high-risk features requires a four millimeter margin of normal tissue around the visible tumor to result in 95% histologic cure rate.\
Cryotherapy & Useful for small, well defined, low risk invasive SCCs and Bowen's disease. & Destroys malignant cells by freezing and thawing. Cryotherapy does not permit histologic confirmation of the adequacy of treatment margins; thus, a substantial amount of training and experience is required to achieve consistently high cure rates.\
Radiation therapy & An option for the initial management of small, well-defined, primary SCCs, especially older patients and those who are not surgical candidates. & However radiation therapy is contraindicated on tumors located on trunk and extremities. These areas are subjected to greater trauma and tension than skin on the head and neck, and they are more prone to break down and ulcerate as a result of the atrophy and poor vascularity of irradiated tissue.\
Topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) & Actinic keratoses & Although topical 5 -FU is not approved for the treatment of Bowen's disease (squamous-cell carcinoma in-situ) and superficial SCCs, it is widely used in these diseases when other treatment modalities are impractical and for patients who refuse surgical treatment.\

Inflammatory Skin Lesions
-------------------------

### Psoriasis

-   Psoriasis is usually bilateral and involves extensor surfaces of elbows and knees.

-   Although psoriasis can present with involvement in patches, it usually plaque-like, with scaly, elevated lesions.

### Lichen PLanus

-   Lichen planus typically presents as 2-10 mm flat-topped papules with an irregular, angulated border (polygonal papules) that are commonly located on the flexor surface of wrists and and on the legs immediately above the ankles.

-   Most of the times, the lesions are multiple.

-   Lichen planus is common in middle age.

### Seborrheic Keratoses

-   Elevated hyperpigmented lesions with a well-circumscribed border, stuck-on appearance, and variable tan-brown-black color and are most commonly located on the face and trunk.

### Eczema

-   Eczema can appear erythematous and is often pruritic.

-   Typically occurs behind the ears and on flexural areas.

Treatment

-   Medium-strength corticosteroid cream to decrease inflammatory process unless the lesion is dry, in which case ointment may be a better vehicle for the corticosteroid.

-   In addition, regular use of emollient to soften the lesion and prevent exacerbations.

### Actinic Keratonses

-   Actinic keratoses are scaly keratotic patches that are often more easily felt than seen.

-   A history of significant sun exposure is a risk factor for actinic keratosis.

Infectious Skin Conditions
--------------------------

### Tinea Capitis

Management

-   Oral therapy is required to adequately treat tinea capitis, as they are able to penetrate the infected hair shaft where topical therapies cannot.

-   Griseofulvin is the first-line oral antifungal treatment approved for use. Suggested dosing is 20-25 mg/kg/day using the microsize formulation, for 6-12 weeks. Where the ultramicrosize formulation is used, a dose of 10-15 mg/kg/day is suggested, as it is more rapidly absorbed than the microsize form.

-   Terbinafine hydrochloide was also approved by FDA in 2007 for tinea capitis for children ages 4 years and older. The approved pediatric dose of terbinafine granule is 125 mg, 187.5 mg, or 250 mg for children weighing less than 25 kg, 25 to 35 kg, and more than 35 kg, respectively, once daily for 6 weeks.

-   In multiple studies, terbinafine was consistently more effective than griseofulvin against tinea capitis caused by Trichophyton tonsurans. However, in children with microsporum infection, new evidence suggests that the effect of griseofulvin is better than that of terbinafine.

### Tinea Unquium / Onychomycosis

Treatment: Oral antifungal with affinity for keratin

-   terbinafine 250 mg/day for 12 weeks (toenails) or 6 weeks (fingernails only)

-   itraconazole 200 mg twice daily as pulse therapy

    -   one pulse: 1 week of itraconazole followed by 3 weeks without itraconazole

    -   two pulses: fingernails

    -   three pulses: toenails

### Tinea Pedis, Tinea Manuum, Tinea Corporis, Tinea Cruris

#### Tinea Pedis

This is a ubiquitous dermatophyte infection and the most common of the superficial fungal infections.

Local friction and warmth between the toes, in combination with the patient's wearing and frequency of changing of socks and shoes as well as wearing of wet shoes for a prolonged period of time, and the accumulation of moisture in his feet, particularly between the toes represent common contributory factors.

Other factors could be diabetes, immune compromising states such as chronic steroid therapy, and chemotherapy. HIV/AIDS can also lead to tinea pedis and onycomycosis.

The diagnosis is often made clinically but can also be aided with microscopy, where scrapings from the affected area are examined under microscopy, after treatment with potassium hydroxide.

#### Treatment: Topical antifungal medications

-   A wide variety of topical agents are available, in cream, gel, lotion, and shampoo formulations. A majority of the agents are of the 'azole' antifungal family (clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole, coiconazole, ticonazole, etc.).

-   Terbinafine and naftifine represent the 'allylamine' family of agents. Both families of drugs are known for their high efficacy against the dermatophytes.

Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer
------------------------

Risk factors

-   Increasing age

-   Male \>\>\> female

-   Previous skin cancer of any type gives 36% to 52% five-year risk of second skin cancer

-   80% of lifetime sun exposure is obtained before 18 years of age (single greatest risk factor)

-   People who burn easily, burn scars

-   People who tan poorly and freckle

-   Chronic osteomyelitis sinus tracts

-   Chronic skin ulcers

-   Xeroderma pigmentosum

-   Human papillomavirus infection

-   Use of coal-tar products, Tobacco use, Psoralen use (PUVA therapy)

-   Outdoor work

-   Red, blonde or light brown hair

-   Celtic ancestry

-   Fair complexions

-   Living near equator (UV exposure)

### Squamous Cell Carcinomas

-   Squamous cell carcinomas are scaly and erythematous but, unlike actinic keratoses, tend have a raised base.

-   Lesions may take the form of a patch, plaque, or nodule, sometimes with scaling and/or an ulcerated center.

-   Borders are often irregular and bleed easily.

-   Unlike basal cell carcinomas, the heaped-up edges of a squamous cell carcinoma are fleshy rather than clear in appearance.

-   Squamous cell carcinoma comprises 20 percent of all cases of skin cancer.

-   History of significant sun exposure is a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma and it typically occurs on areas of the skin that have been exposed to sunlight for many years, such as the extremities or face.

#### Squamous cell carcinoma in-situ (Bowen's diease)

Management

-   Surgical Excision\

### Basal cell Carcinomas

-   Basal cell carcinomas may be plaque-like or nodular with a waxy, translucent appearance, often with ulceration and/or telangiectasia.

-   Usually there is no associated itching or change in skin color.

-   Basal cell carcinoma is common on the face and on other exposed skin surfaces but may occur anywhere.

-   Comprising 60 percent of primary skin cancers, basal cell carcinomas are typically slow-growing lesions that invade local tissues but rarely metastasize.

-   A long history of sun exposure is a risk factor for basal cell carcinoma.

Melanoma Skin Cancer

-   \"Intense, intermittent exposure and blistering sunburns in childhood and adolescence are associated with increased risk\"

-   Living near equator (UV exposure)

-   Radiation exposure

-   People who burn easily

-   People who tan poorly and freckle

-   Melanoma in 1st or 2nd degree relative

-   Familial atypical mole-melanoma syndrome (FAMMS)

-   Nonfamilial dysplastic nevi

-   Indoor work

-   Higher incidence in those with more education and/or income

-   Celtic ancestry

-   Fair complexions

-   Red, blonde or light brown hair

-   Large number of benign pigmented nevi

-   Giant pigmented congenital nevi

-   Nondysplastic nevi (markers for risk, not precursor lesions)

4 types of melanoma

-   superficial spreading melanoma: young

-   lentigo melanoma: Hawaii,

-   acral lentiginous melanoma: darker, acral

-   nodular melanoma: discover depth

Clark and Breslow staging

-   Depth being the most important prognostic factor

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   In the United States, the median age at diagnosis of melanoma is 53, with about one in four new cases occurring in those younger than 40 years.

-   Lesions that are growing, spreading or pigmented, or those that occur on exposed areas of skin are of particular concern for melanoma.

-   Although it comprises only 1 percent of all skin cancers, malignant melanoma accounts for over 60 percent of skin cancer deaths.

-   The lesions of superficial spreading melanoma are dark brown or black.

-   Slowly spreading irregular outline in the initial phase. Some areas may be a lighter shade.

-   Since not all malignant melanomas are visibly pigmented, physicians should be suspicious of any lesion that is growing or that bleeds with minor trauma.

-   More than half of melanoma in females occurs on the legs.

-   Sun exposure is a risk factor for melanoma; studies have shown that the prevalence of melanoma increases with proximity to the equator.

-   Persons with skin types that burns easily and tans with difficulty, and with red or blond hair, and freckles are at higher risk.

-   Although cumulative sun exposure is linked to nonmelanoma skin cancer, intermittent intense sun exposure seems to be more related to melanoma risk.
