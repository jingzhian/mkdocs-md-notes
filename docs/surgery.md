Pre-surgical Evaluation and Patient Preparations
------------------------------------------------

### Thrombophilia

#### Screening for Inherited Thrombophilia

Although there are no absolute indications for screening for inherited thrombophilias, expert opinion on which patients are likely to benefit from such investigations includes patients with one of the following:

-   Initial thrombosis occurring prior to age 50 without an immediately identified risk factor (e.g., idiopathic or unprovoked venous thrombosis).

-   A family history of venous thromboembolism.

-   Recurrent venous thrombosis.

-   Thrombosis occurring in unusual vascular beds such as portal, hepatic, mesenteric, or cerebral veins.

There is currently no evidence to support any change in outcome when using such a strategy.

#### Management

More than 95% of pulmonary emboli arise from thrombi in the deep venous system of the lower extremities. Ninety percent of deaths due to pulmonary embolism result within an hour or two -- before diagnostic and therapeutic plans can be implemented. Therefore, prevention and prompt treatment of DVT is the most effective approach to prevention of, and death due to, embolism.

The goals of management of DVT therefore are

-   Immediate inhibition of the growth of thromboemboli

-   Promotion of thromboembolic resolution

-   Prevention of recurrence

In order to treat DVT on an outpatient basis, the patient must be:

-   Hemodynamically stable

-   With good kidney function

-   At low risk for bleeding

The home environment must be:

-   Stable and supportive

-   Capable of providing the patient with daily access to INR monitoring (if using warfarin as the anticoagulant)

Most patients with DVT may be managed in the out-patient setting, though there are a few important exceptions (see below).

Pharmacological Therapy of DVT:\
Two oral factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban) have been demonstrated to be safe as monotherapy for DVT (option B). These agents have been shown to have similar efficacy to warfarin in preventing PE, but have been demonstrated to cause fewer bleeding episodes than warfarin. Advantages include that they do not require any laboratory monitoring, so they are much easier for patients to take.

Disadvantages include their cost (compared to warfarin, which is very inexpensive) and the unavailability of immediate reversal agents in the case of dangerous bleeding. The American College of Chest Physicians recently recommended the choice of factor Xa inhibitors or the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran (collectively referred to as non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants or NOACs) over warfarin for the management of DVT or PE.

The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran is another option for oral anticoagulation that has similar advantages to rivaroxaban and apixaban. It has not been studied as monotherapy however (option E), so it is recommended that patients be initiated on LMWH with five to 10 days of overlap.

Before the development of the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), warfarin was the mainstay of the management of DVT. It remains an acceptable option and remains commonly used in many settings. Warfarin is a better option for patients who can't afford the cost of the NOACs and who are concerned about the lack of reversal agents. Warfarin takes several days to reach therapeutic efficacy, so simply starting it alone carries an unacceptable risk of PE (option A). Thus, patients must be started on either LMWH or unfractionated heparin while waiting for the patient's INR to come into the therapeutic range (2-3). LMWH is the preferred anticoagulant to pair with warfarin in most settings, and may be administered in the outpatient setting (option D)

For many years, the standard of care for DVT was admission to the hospital and administration of unfractionated heparin overlapping with the initiation of warfarin (option C). Inpatient management remains the best option for patients who are hemodynamically unstable, who are at serious risk of acute bleeding with the initiation of anticoagulation (e.g. those with prior admission for gastrointestinal bleeding), or who have obstacles to outpatient management. Examples of this include the inability to afford NOACs and LMWH, or inability to get daily INRs checked during the initiation of warfarin therapy.

Finally, The duration of anticoagulation depends on whether the patient has a first episode of DVT, ongoing risk factors for venous thromboembolic disease, and known thrombophilia. If these are absent, treat for 3 months, if present, indefinitely.
