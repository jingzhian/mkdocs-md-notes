Foundation for Surgery
----------------------
### Airway Management

Nasotracheal intubation may be performed over a fiberoptic laryngoscope, or more often, the endotracheal tube is blindly passed through the nose and then direct laryngoscopy is performed to visualize the tube passing through the larynx.  However, this adds unnecessary complexity (and increased time) to this patient's management, does not decrease neck extension, and does not result in a safer airway than orotracheal intubation.

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure) is used primarily to improve oxygenation.  This does not improve ventilation but only oxygenation.  Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation also does not provide airway protection.

Needle cricothyroidotomy can be performed when other, less invasive techniques of airway management have failed (or are likely to fail).  It is used only temporarily until a more secure airway can be placed because it offers no airway protection from secretions, may lead to CO2 retention (and is particularly inappropriate in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure), and gives less feedback about respiratory function (eg, ventilatory volumes, pressures, gas exchange).

Orotracheal intubation carries less risk (eg, bleeding, tracheal stenosis) and can be performed quicker than surgical tracheostomy; therefore, it is first-line management.  In addition, the neck is often extended during tracheostomy, so this procedure would not necessarily prevent cervical spine movement.

#### Manual Ventilation of the Lungs with Bag-Valve-Mask System

### Breathing

#### Administration of supplemental oxygen

#### Clearing tracheobronchial secretions from airway or tracheostomy tube

#### Mechanical Ventilation

 In some mechanically ventilated patients with hypoxemia, increasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can help keep alveoli open at the end of the expiratory phase and improve oxygen diffusion. 

Repositioning the endotracheal tube is appropriate if chest x-ray reveals malpositioning (eg, tip in the right mainstem bronchus). 

Positive pressure mechanical ventilation causes an acute increase in intrathoracic pressure. In the setting of decreased central venous pressure (eg, hypovolemic shock), initiation of mechanical ventilation can cause acute loss of right ventricular preload, loss of cardiac output, and cardiac arrest.

### Circulation

#### Arterial puncture for arterial blood gas analysis

#### Peripheral venous cannulation (IV plug)

#### Set-up of infusion giving set

#### Venepuncture

### Delivery of Medication

#### Adminstration of nebulised medication / metered dose inhaler

#### Application of tropical medicine (inc suppositories)

#### Calculation of dosage and administration of subcutaneous (SC) insulin

#### Intradermal injection (Mantoux tests)

#### Intralesional injections

#### Intramuscular injections

#### Subcutaneous injections

### Examinations and Investigations

- See sections on ENT and opthalmology for otoscopy and fundoscopy techniques. 
- See pulmonary medicine for peak flow measurements
- See cardiology for ECG reading

#### Rectal examination and proctoscopy

#### Blood culture

#### Capillary blood sugar measurement

#### Finger/Heel Prick

#### Joint Aspirations

#### Swabs for Pus Culture

#### Urine Dipsticks

### Nutrition

#### NGT for enteral nutrition

Although enteral nutrition through a nasogastric tube can increase the risk of aspiration (particularly when patients are supine), it should be used when possible because total parenteral nutrition, which is administered through a central line, is associated with a high rate of complications (eg, bloodstream infection due to the central line).



Frameworks
---------
### Post-Op Fever
The classic list consists of five W's – Wind, Water, Wound, Walking, and Wonder Drugs, but two other causes should also be considered – Wing/Waterway and (W)abscess. 

Category | Day | Description
|-----|-------|------
Wind | POD 1-2 | the lungs, i.e. pneumonia, aspiration, and pulmonary embolism; atelectasis has been commonly cited as a cause of post-operative fever, but supporting evidence is lacking
Water | POD 3-5 | 	urinary tract infection, possibly catheter-associated (if a urinary catheter was inserted during surgery or remains in place currently i.e. Foley catheter)
Wound | POD 5-7|infection of the surgical incision(s), either superficial or deep
(W)abscess|POD 5-7|infection of an organ or space
Walking (or VEINS pronounced like "Weins")	|POD 5+| (risk may persist for months post-operatively)	deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
Wonder drugs or “What did we do?”	|Anytime|	drug fever or reaction to blood products, either a febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction or transfusion-related acute lung injury
Wing/Waterway	|Anytime|	bloodstream infection, phlebitis, or cellulitis related to intravenous lines, either central or peripheral

### Acute abdominal/pelvic pain



Red Flags Indicating a Life-threatening condition in a patient with abdominal or pelvic pain include:

-   History
    -   Abrupt onset of severe pain
    -   Fever
    -   Vomiting and or diarrhea
    -   Weight loss
    -   Menstrual changes
    -   Trauma or previous surgeries
    -   History or presence of blood in emesis and / or stool

-   Physical
    -   GI disfunction: Absent bowel sounds
    -   Distension and /or rigid abdomen
    -   Peritoneal irritation signs: Rebound tenderness
    -   Pulsatile abdominal mass
    -   Bleeding signs: Echymoses / bruising, Shock with hypotension and tachycardia

Differential diagnosis

-   Hepatitis
-   Pancreatitis
-   Cholescystitis
-   Cholangitis
-   Gastritis / PUD
-   GERD
-   IBD
-   Appendicitis
-   UTI
-   Vaginitis
-   Ovarian pathology
-   Pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy
-   Pelvic inflammatory disease
-   Trauma
-   MSK pain
-   Psychosomatic pain / stress

Diagnosis | Clinical presentation 
|---|---
Acute appendicitis | Causes right-sided lower abdominal pain with leukocytosis.  Although physical examination findings of an acute abdomen may be similar to those from hemoperitoneum, hematocrit does not decrease with appendicitis.
Cholelithiasis | typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and right upper quadrant pain.  Examination findings are focal right upper quadrant tenderness without a drop in hematocrit.
Splenic rupture | typically presents as left-sided upper abdominal pain &pm; signs of hemoperitoneum
Diverticulitis | typically presents as left-sided lower abdominal pain; it does not lead to a diffuse acute abdomen or a drop in hematocrit.
Acute mesenteric ischemia | Results from inadequate intestinal circulation (eg, thromboembolism).  The resultant intestinal infarction classically presents as a relatively normal abdominal examination despite excruciating pain.

#### Extra Considerations in Women

Diagnosis | Clinical presentation | Ultrasound findings
|---|---|---
Mittelschmerz | Recurrent mild & unilateral mid-cycle pain prior to ovulation lasting hours to days | Not indicated
Ectopic pregnancy | Amenorrhea, abdominal/pelvic pain & vaginal bleeding; Positive β-hCG | No intrauterine pregnancy
Ovarian torsion | Sudden-onset, severe, unilateral lower abdominal pain; nausea & vomiting; Unilateral, tender adnexal mass on examination | Enlarged ovary with decreased or absent blood flow
Ruptured ovarian cyst | Sudden-onset, severe, unilateral lower abdominal pain immediately following strenuous or sexual activity| Pelvic free fluid
Pelvic inflammatory disease | Fever/chills, vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain & cervical motion tenderness | ± Tubo-ovarian abscess

Ovarian torsion may present with sudden lower abdominal pain; it does not typically result in an acute abdomen on physical examination and does not cause a drop in hematocrit.



### Mediastinal Mass

*Thymoma* is usually found in the *anterior* mediastinum. The diagnosis is suspected when an anterior mediastinal mass presents in a young male or female. About 20% of patients with myasthenia gravis have a thymoma. Other anterior mediastinal masses include: retrosternal thyroid, teratoma, and lymphoma.  If the mass is large, patients may complain of chest heaviness or discomfort. Hoarseness, Horner's syndrome, and facial and upper extremity edema may occur when the tumors invade locally. Thymoma is a neoplasm of the thymus classically associated with systemic syndromes, including myasthenia gravis and pemphigus.

Bronchogenic cysts are located in the middle mediastinum and are benign entities. Bronchogenic cysts are uncommon causes of anterior mediastinal masses. They are congenital and arise due to abnormal development of the foregut, although symptoms may not develop until late childhood or early adulthood. They appear as fluid-filled or air/fluid-filled cystic structures on imaging. Elevated AFP and β-hCG are not associated.

Other middle mediastinal masses include: tracheal tumors, pericardial cysts, lymphoma, lymph node enlargement, and aortic aneurysms of the arch.

All *neurogenic* tumors are located in the *posterior* mediastinum. These include: meningocele, enteric cysts, lymphomas, diaphragmatic hernias, esophageal tumors, and aortic aneurysms. MRI is the best modality to evaluate posterior mediastinal masses.

Esophageal leiomyomas are located in the posterior mediastinum.  Esophageal leiomyomas are submucosal and usually asymptomatic. They only produce symptoms when > 5 cm. Only large tumors should be removed.

Infection with histoplasmosis may occasionally cause significant mediastinal adenopathy (mediastinal granuloma). 

#### Retrosternal Goiters

Retrosternal goiters usually manifest with compressive symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and dysphagia. Thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine may be abnormal, depending on thyroid function, but AFP and β-hCG would be normal.

#### Hodgkin lymphoma 

a common cause of mediastinal mass with weight loss in young patients. It also frequently involves the cervical, supraclavicular, and axillary nodes. However, elevations in AFP and β-hCG are not characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma.

#### Germ Cell Tumors

Germ cell tumors typically affect young patients and display aggressive biologic behavior. Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors typically produce both alpha fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin tumor markers.

 patient has a large anterior mediastinal mass with elevated levels of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP), consistent with a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor. Primary mediastinal germ cell tumors occur predominantly in young male patients and are locally invasive. β-hCG is typically elevated in both seminomatous and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, but **nonseminomatous germ cell tumors** typically also produce **AFP**, which is not produced by seminomas **(Choice I)**. A large mediastinal mass with associated elevations of AFP and β-hCG is virtually diagnostic of a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor.

The diagnosis can be confirmed with biopsy. Testicular ultrasound should be performed to exclude a small primary tumor as management and prognosis differ between primary mediastinal and metastatic germ cell tumors. Almost all germ cell tumors in the anterior mediastinum are primary rather than metastatic.

#### Teratomas

Benign teratomas typically include tissue from all 3 germ layers and may present as mediastinal tumors. 





### Abdominal Mass

| Mass  | Features |
| ----------- | -------------- |
|Incisional hernia | develop due to fascial closure breakdown and may have a delayed presentation (months-years).  Patients typically have a slowly enlarging abdominal mass (ie, protruding abdominal contents) that is palpable while supine and enlarges with the Valsalva maneuver.|
|Metastatic uterine sarcoma | may cause an abdominal mass, but tumor size is not affected by the Valsalva maneuver.  In addition, this diagnosis typically has associated systemic symptoms (eg, weight loss).|
|Subcutaneous lipoma | A soft tissue tumor that can appear as an abdominal mass; however, lipomas are not typically located in the midline and do not enlarge with Valsalva.|
|Rectus sheath hematoma  | may present as an abdominal mass.  However, it is usually associated with acute trauma and pain rather than with a slowly enlarging, uncomfortable bulge, as in this patient.  In addition, hematoma size does not change with Valsalva.|
|Rectus abdominis diastasis | A bulge between the rectus muscles due to linea alba weakening.  However, unlike a true hernia, it has no associated fascial defect; therefore, the abnormality is not palpable while supine.|

Surgical Emergencies 
--------------------
### Acute Compartment Syndrome

Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) occurs when excessive fluid accumulation in a confined compartment of the body (eg, upper leg, lower leg, upper arm, forearm, hand, foot, abdomen) causes an increase in compartment pressure to the point that blood flow is severely impaired.  Pain out of proportion to clinical findings is often the first presenting symptom, and worsening pain may be elicited with passive stretch of the affected muscle compartment.  Tissue tension, pallor, and decreased sensation may also be present.  If elevated compartment pressure is allowed to persist, tissue ischemia and eventual tissue death will occur.  The eschar that results from a circumferential, full-thickness (third degree) burn often leads to constriction of venous and lymphatic drainage, fluid accumulation, and resulting distal ACS.

**Risk Factors**
- Circumferential, full-thickness (third degree) burns can result in eschar formation that restricts venous and lymphatic drainage, leading to acute compartment syndrome.

**Clinical Features**
- Common
  - pain out of proportion to injury
  - pain increase on passive stretch
  - rapidly increasing and tense swelling
  - paresthesia (early)
- Uncommon
  - decreased sensation
  - motor weakness within hours
  - paralysis (late)
  - decreased distal pulses (uncommon)

**Differentials**
- Venous thrombosis of the upper extremity can lead to pain and swelling, especially in patients with increased risk, such as burn patients; Swelling and tissue tension should not be profound in venous thrombosis
- Cellulitis due to subcutaneous bacterial invasion: warmth
- Gas gangrene due to Clostridium perfringens: crepitus
- Inflammatory arthritis (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) is characterized by pain and swelling often involving the bilateral metacarpal phalangeal joints.

Overall, clinical findings for ACS can be unreliable, and a high clinical suspicion should be maintained in patients with significant injuries to the extremities, especially the distal extremities.  Serial compartment pressure monitoring is useful in determining the need for definitive operative management, which consists of compartment decompression by fasciotomy or, in the case of circumferential burns, escharotomy.

#### Abdominal compartment syndrome
presents with wide-ranging organ dysfunction (eg, decreased cardiac output, increased intracranial pressure, renal impairment) in patients with increased intra-abdominal pressure secondary to large-volume resuscitation, burns, or other abdominal conditions (eg, ascites, liver transplantation).

### Shock 

- 

### Sepsis 

### Bleeding

#### Hemoperitoneum

This patient presents with hemoperitoneum due to a ruptured ovarian cyst.  Corpus luteum cysts form in the second half of the menstrual cycle, after ovulation has occurred.  Although hemoperitoneum does not typically occur with ovarian cyst rupture, patients who are on anticoagulation can bleed intra-abdominally and become hemodynamically unstable.  Typical presentation of a ruptured cyst is sudden onset of unilateral lower abdominal pain.  Symptoms of hemoperitoneum include diffuse severe abdominal pain, pleuritic chest pain, and shoulder pain (due to phrenic nerve irritation).  Physical examination with a ruptured ovarian cyst shows unilateral lower quadrant tenderness; with hemoperitoneum, diffuse abdominal rigidity with rebound and guarding is present.  Laboratory testing shows a decreased hematocrit due to intra-abdominal blood loss.  Pelvic ultrasound confirms intra-abdominal and pelvic free fluid and a possible adnexal mass (if the cyst is incompletely drained).  Treatment of a hemodynamically unstable patient with hemoperitoneum due to a ruptured ovarian cyst is surgery to stop the bleeding.

 Splenic rupture may cause hemoperitoneum, but it typically presents as left-sided upper abdominal pain.

### Air Embolism

#### Venous Air Embolism
Patients who developed rapid decompensation and cardiac arrest following central venous catheter placement most likely experienced a venous air embolism (VAE).  VAE results from the introduction of air into the venous circulation; potential causes include trauma, certain surgeries (eg, neurosurgical, otolaryngological), central venous catheters, and pulmonary barotrauma.

A small VAE often causes minimal sequelae, travelling to the pulmonary capillaries where it can diffuse into the alveoli without consequence.  However, a large VAE (eg, >50 mL) can lodge in the right ventricle to cause right ventricular outflow tract obstruction or lodge within the pulmonary arterioles to obstruct pulmonary blood flow.  Affected patients usually develop sudden-onset dyspnea and respiratory distress, often accompanied by obstructive shock (with hypotension and tachycardia) that can lead to cardiac arrest (eg, pulseless electrical activity).  As with thrombotic pulmonary embolism, hypoxemia can result from dead space ventilation and ventilation-perfusion mismatching due to obstructed pulmonary blood flow.

Etiologies
- Trauma, certain surgeries (e.g. neurosurgical)
- Central venous catheter manipulation
- Barotrauma (e.g. positive-pressure ventilation)

Clinical Manifestation
- Sudden-onset respiratory distress
- Hypoxemia, obstructive shock, cardiac arrest

Management
- Left lateral decubitus positioning
- High-flow or hyperbaric oxygen

#### Arterial Air Embolism
Air embolism can also affect the arterial circulation, most commonly due to trauma or neurosurgical procedures.  Manifestations of arterial air embolism include stroke and myocardial infarction (due to cerebral or coronary micro-arterial occlusion, respectively), the latter of which can lead to rapid cardiac arrest.


Trauma 
------------
Triage
1. GCS
2. Vitals


### LOC in Trauma
All trauma patients should be triaged using the Glasgow coma scale (GCS), which can predict the severity and prognosis of coma, during the primary survey.  The GCS assesses the patient's ability to open his/her eyes, motor response, and verbal response.

All trauma patients should be first assessed using the GCS, which estimates the severity of the patient's neurologic injury for triage.  The GCS can also give some prognostic information when used in conjunction with the patient's age and presence of concomitant adverse clinical findings, such as hypoxia, cardiovascular compromise, increased intracranial pressure, and radiographic evidence of a midline shift of the brain.  Calculation of GCS score is shown below.

Category | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1
|---|---|---|---|---
Eye opening | Spontaneous | To verbal command | To pain | None
Verbal response | Oriented | Disoriented / confused | Inappropriate words | Incomprehensible sounds | None
Motor response | Obeys | Localize | Withdraws | Flexion posturing (Decorticate) | Extension posturing (decerebrate) | none

The GCS is used to predict the prognosis of coma and other medical conditions, such as bacterial meningitis, traumatic brain injury, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.  However, the GCS is not used to diagnose coma in a patient.  Findings used to diagnose coma include impaired brainstem activity (e.g., disruption of the pupillary light, extraocular, and corneal reflexes), motor dysfunction (e.g., decorticate or decerebrate posturing), and impaired level of consciousness.


Exaggerated deep tendon reflexes can be seen in locked-in syndrome, which mimics coma but is due to an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke of the brainstem area.  Patients have total paralysis of the limbs and an inability to speak, retain cognition and alertness, and can only communicate with their eyes.

The gag reflex is tested to evaluate for proper cranial nerve function and swallowing mechanism to prevent foreign objects from entering the pharynx, larynx, or trachea.  Up to 20% of the normal patients can have an absent gag reflex.  

Capillary refill is a marker of peripheral perfusion.  It can be delayed beyond the normal 3 seconds in hypotension and volume depletion.

Aspiration pneumonitis (eg, aspiration of inflammatory gastric acid during post-collision unconsciousness) and trauma can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  Both aspiration pneumonitis and ARDS may cause progressive desaturation and increased oxygen requirement; however, infiltrates (rather than extensive extrapulmonary air) would be expected on chest x-ray.



### Myocardial Contusion

Myocardial contusion from blunt thoracic trauma can lead to myocardial dysfunction and cardiogenic shock. The resulting left heart failure can lead to pulmonary edema and hypoxia; however, it typically also causes hypotension (not seen in this patient) from forward pump failure.

### Shock in Trauma

- During the trauma survey of hemodynamically unstable (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) patients, the source(s) of instability should be investigated quickly.  This includes ruling out rapidly fatal intrathoracic conditions (eg, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade) and identifying major sources of hemorrhage. 
- Shock refractory to initial fluid resuscitation is shock that does not correct with 2L of crystalloid

#### Hemorrhagic Shock
- Because hemorrhagic shock is the most common type of shock in the trauma setting, particular attention is given during trauma survey to areas where large blood loss can occur ("blood on the floor and 4 more"):
  - External bleeding ("the floor"):  up to the entire blood volume
  - Chest:  up to 40% of the blood volume/hemithorax
  - Abdomen (ie, peritoneal cavity):  up to the entire blood volume
  - Pelvis:  up to the entire blood volume; blood loss often hidden within the retroperitoneum
    - Pelvic fracture can cause tearing of the thin-walled venous plexus (presacral, lumbar), leading to life-threatening hemorrhage. 
    - For early detection of this potentially lethal injury, pelvic x-ray is typically performed as an adjunct to the trauma primary survey.
  - Thigh:  up to 1-2 L/thigh

Pancreatic injury can occur with blunt abdominal trauma, especially when the pancreas is rapidly compressed (eg, steering wheel impact) against the vertebral column.  However, even severe injuries (eg, transection with pancreatic fluid leakage) do not typically cause acute hemodynamic instability.  They more commonly result in symptoms similar to those of pancreatitis (eg, abdominal pain, nausea, emesis).

Vasopressor therapy is contraindicated in the setting of isolated hemorrhagic shock because peripheral vascular tone is already increased (ie, vasoconstriction) to compensate for decreased blood volume.  Continued volume resuscitation (eg, crystalloid, blood products) is more appropriate.

#### Adrenal Crisis
Adrenal crisis can be precipitated by trauma and cause shock refractory to fluid resuscitation.  However, this occurs much more commonly in patients with underlying adrenal insufficiency (eg, autoimmune-mediated adrenalitis, adrenal suppression from chronic glucocorticoid use) rather than in previously healthy patients.  Bilateral adrenal infarct/hemorrhage from trauma is extremely rare.

#### Neurogenic Shock
Spinal fracture can cause spinal cord injury leading to neurogenic shock.  However, neurogenic shock is typically associated with flaccid paralysis (vs normal muscle tone), as well as hypotension with bradycardia (vs tachycardia) from sudden loss of sympathetic tone.  Severe intracranial hemorrhage may also cause neurogenic shock or, alternately, Cushing triad (from increased intracranial pressure, characterized by hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respiration.

### Long Bone or Pelvic Fracure

#### Fat Embolism
Fat embolism can cause hypoxemia but typically occurs after long bone or pelvic fracture and is accompanied by petechial rash and neurologic changes.

### Blunt Chest / Abdominal Trauma

Patients with BAT who do not have frank peritonitis (an indication for immediate laparotomy) should undergo Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST).  A positive FAST strongly suggests intraabdominal injury; however, a negative FAST does not rule it out because it can miss early bleeding or injuries (eg, bowel perforation) that do not produce detectable (eg, >200 mL) amounts of free fluid.

For hemodynamically stable (eg, systolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg) patients with a negative FAST:

- High suspicion of intraabdominal injury, as in this patient with tachycardia, LUQ pain, and referred shoulder pain, should prompt contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.  Intravenous contrast "blush" (extravasation) can often identify active bleeding.
- Low suspicion of intraabdominal injury (eg, normal vital signs, nontender abdomen) can be managed with serial physical examinations, which are performed to rule out occult injury progression.

Diagnostic peritoneal lavage may be considered for a negative/inconclusive FAST in hemodynamically unstable patients whose condition may clinically deteriorate during CT scan.  Immediate exploratory laparotomy is indicated for peritonitis (regardless of hemodynamic status) or for a positive FAST in an hemodynamically unstable patient.

For patients with BAT (regardless of hemodynamic status), frank peritonitis (eg, rigidity) warrants immediate laparotomy.  In the absence of peritonitis (as in this patient), FAST examination should be performed to identify intraperitoneal free fluid (eg, blood, urine, spilled enteric contents).

In hemodynamically unstable patients, a positive FAST confirms significant intraabdominal injury and therefore warrants emergent laparotomy.  If FAST is negative or inconclusive, additional investigations should be considered:

CT scan can often visualize the site and severity of intraabdominal injury but requires improved hemodynamic stability following resuscitation due to the risk of rapid deterioration in the CT scanner (Choice A). 
Bedside diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) may be considered in patients who remain too hemodynamically unstable for CT scan despite resuscitation (Choice C). 

#### Rib Fracture

| Location      | Associated Injuries                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Ribs 1-3**  | Subclavian vessels, brachial plexus, mediastinal vessels (eg, aorta) |
| **Ribs 3-6**  | Cardiovascular                                               |
| **Ribs 9-12** | Intraabdominal: liver (right), spleen (left), kidney (posterior ribs 11 & 12) |
| **Any level** | Pulmonary                                                    |



#### Flial Chest

Flail chest occurs when fracture of **≥3 contiguous ribs in ≥2 locations** creates an isolated chest wall segment (flail segment) that **moves paradoxically** (opposite) to the rest of the rib cage during respiration. Typically, the extreme trauma to the chest wall that creates the flail segment also contuses the underlying lung (eg, causing diminished anterior breath sounds beneath this patient's anterior flail segment).

Flail chest negatively impacts respiration and oxygenation in multiple ways, including the following:

- **Impaired generation of negative intrathoracic pressure** during inspiration and increased dead space during expiration cause **ineffective ventilation**.
- **Pulmonary contusion** (with alveolar hemorrhage and edema) in the underlying lung impedes oxygen diffusion.
- Fracture-related pain causes respiratory splinting and **atelectasis**.

Therefore patients present with tachypnea, hypoxia, and a segment of the chest wall that moves inward during inspiration.

Flail chest often results in respiratory failure requiring mechanical positive pressure ventilation, which, due to positive pressure, can force the flail segment to move outward with the rest of the rib cage during inspiration.



This patient with respiratory distress and multiple rib fractures on chest x-ray likely has **flail chest**. Flail chest occurs when **fracture of ≥3 adjacent ribs in ≥2 locations** (multiple x-ray views are usually required to see both locations) creates an isolated chest wall segment that **moves paradoxically** to the remaining rib cage during respiration. The paradoxical motion impairs generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration. As a result, tidal volume decreases and work of breathing increases.

In addition, the extreme blunt force required to create flail chest typically injures the underlying lung. The resulting **pulmonary contusion** (eg, seen on x-ray as infiltrates underlying this patient's rib fractures) decreases oxygen diffusion (due to alveolar hemorrhage and edema). As a result, patients must breathe harder to maintain oxygenation. The combination of **increased work of breathing** and decreased oxygenation causes many patients, such as this one, to fatigue and develop **respiratory failure**, requiring mechanical ventilation.



#### Tracheobranchial injury

This patient with blunt chest trauma (high-speed motor vehicle collision, anterior chest wall bruises) initially has a tension pneumothorax (absent breath sounds, hypotension) and subcutaneous air (crepitus).  Despite appropriate tube thoracostomy, repeat chest x-ray shows rapid pneumothorax reaccumulation (leading to declining oxygen saturation) and increased subcutaneous emphysema.  This suggests a tracheobronchial injury in which a large quantity of air escapes with each breath.  The rapidity of extrapulmonary air accumulation in this patient is consistent with proximal (eg, bronchial) airway rupture because the larger diameter of the more proximal airway leads to more air leakage.

Tracheobronchial injury should be considered in trauma patients with extensive extrapulmonary air.  Classic findings are rapid, large air leak into the chest-tube drainage system and persistent pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum despite tube thoracostomy.  Bronchoscopy is the definitive test for diagnosis; high-resolution CT scan can diagnose major injuries but may miss small tears.  Most patients require operative repair.

Persistent pneumothorax and large air leak despite tube thoracostomy in the setting of blunt chest trauma suggest tracheobronchial rupture.  Bronchoscopy can confirm the diagnosis prior to operative repair.

Persistent pneumothorax and large air leak despite tube thoracostomy in the setting of blunt chest trauma suggest tracheobronchial rupture.  Bronchoscopy can confirm the diagnosis prior to operative repair.  

Injury to the tracheobronchial tree can cause extensive air leakage into the mediastinum and pleural space. This can result in pneumothorax (often tension pneumothorax). Massive pneumothorax or hemothorax can increase intrapleural pressure, compress the lung, and prevent adequate ventilation, leading to hypoxia. However, such a large intrapleural collection of air or blood typically causes diffusely diminished or absent breath sounds and/or tracheal deviation from mass effect.



Tracheobronchial injury causes respiratory distress due to rapid leakage of air from the tracheobronchial tree into the pleural space and surrounding tissues. Such injuries typically have associated findings of severe pneumothorax, palpable crepitus (from subcutaneous air), and/or audible crunch on cardiac auscultation (ie, Hamman sign, from pneumomediastinum).

Flexible bronchoscopy visualizes the proximal airway lumen and mucosa to assess airway patency and continuity. In the trauma setting, it may be used to diagnose tracheobronchial injury.

**Bronchial rupture** 

Causes rapid leakage of air from the tracheobronchial tree into the pleural space and surrounding tissues, which can lead to respiratory distress.  However, it classically has associated crepitus and a large pneumothorax, with hyperresonance (rather than dullness) on percussion.

Bronchial rupture causes rapid air leakage from the tracheobronchial tree, manifesting on chest x-ray as pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and/or subcutaneous emphysema. 

**Pneumothorax**

 left-sided tension pneumothorax can produce hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea with rightward tracheal deviation. However, because tension pneumothorax requires a large quantity of intrathoracic air, it would typically cause absent (rather than diminished) breath sounds and hyperresonance (rather than dullness) on percussion.

This patient with **blunt thoracic trauma** (eg, chest run over by a tractor) has evidence of extensive extrapulmonary air, with both a tension pneumothorax (absent breath sounds, tracheal deviation, hypotension) and crepitus (crackling of the neck and chest skin). Even after appropriate treatment of the tension pneumothorax with tube thoracostomy, there is a **persistent large air leak**. This suggests continuous, rapid extrapulmonary air accumulation from a **tracheobronchial injury** that allows (due to the larger diameter of the proximal airway) a large quantity of air to escape with each breath.

Tracheobronchial injury should be considered in any patient with thoracic trauma and extensive extrapulmonary air. **Bronchoscopy**, which can directly visualize the lumen of the tracheobronchial tree, is the definitive test for diagnosis and can be easily performed through the endotracheal tube in intubated patients, such as this one. High-resolution CT scan can diagnose major injuries but may miss small tears. Most patients require **operative repair**.

#### Pulmonary Contusion
Pulmonary contusion represents lung parenchymal bruising (due to transmitted kinetic energy) with resulting alveolar hemorrhage and edema.  It is frequently associated with rib fractures but may occur in their absence, especially in children (whose more elastic chest walls can transmit more kinetic energy without fracturing).

**Clinical Feature**
- Present <24 hours after blunt thoracic trauma
- Tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxiemia, and often with decreased breath sounds (due to alveolar infiltrates)

**Diagnosis**
- Rales or decreased breath sounds
- CT scan (most sensitive) or repeated CXR with patchy, alveolar infiltrate not restricted by anatomical borders
  - Because clinically significant alveolar edema may take hours to accumulate, the initial chest x-ray is often negative.  
  - Because these infiltrates reflect alveolar damage in the lung tissue adjacent to the injury site, they are typically nonlobular (not restricted by anatomic landmarks).  

**Management**
- Pain control
- Pulmonary hygiene (eg, incentive spirometry, chest PT)
- Supplemental oxygen & ventilatory support



Lung atelectasis (with collapsed alveoli) and lung contusion (with resulting alveolar edema) can cause tachypnea (to compensate for ventilation-perfusion mismatch) and tachycardia (to compensate for hypoxemia). In addition, both may cause decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion. However, neither typically causes the severity of hypotension and tachycardia seen in this patient.

#### Myocardial contusion 

Myocardial contusion from blunt thoracic trauma can lead to myocardial dysfunction and cardiogenic shock. The resulting left heart failure can lead to pulmonary edema and hypoxia; it typically also causes hypotension  from forward pump failure.



Myocardial contusion can cause contractile dysfunction (eg, left ventricle) and cardiogenic shock with tachycardia and hypoxemia. However, these symptoms would be accompanied by hypotension. In addition, associated pulmonary edema would be diffuse, rather than anterior and peripheral.

#### Acute respiratory distress syndrome
Acute respiratory distress syndrome can cause increasing dyspnea, hypoxemia, and alveolar infiltrates following trauma; however, the alveolar infiltrates are typically bilateral and do not manifest until 24-48 hours following the traumatic event.
- Aspiration pneumonia can cause tachypnea and hypoxemia but typically has accompanying fever, cough, and purulent sputum.
-  Acute respiratory distress syndrome is often seen in patients with severe trauma and frequently causes increased oxygen requirements and pulmonary infiltrates.  However, most cases occur within 72 hours of the inciting event; in addition, fever and increased secretions would be atypical.



#### Hemothorax
Hemothorax (eg, diminished breath sounds, dullness to percussion) may result from injuries to large (eg, aorta, hilar vessels) or small intrathoracic structures (eg, intercostal blood vessels, lung parenchyma).  In patients with pleuritic chest pain and exquisite chest wall tenderness to palpation, the most likely source is fractured ribs with intercostal vessel injury.  Hemothorax is treated with tube thoracostomy, which is sufficient to resolve many cases, although if immediate chest tube output is >1,500 mL of blood, emergent surgical thoracotomy is indicated.

Both hemothorax (eg, bleeding from injured lung parenchyma) and pneumothorax can cause tachypnea and hypoxemia. Hemothorax would cause an effusion with partial opacification of the hemithorax or blunting of the costophrenic angle on upright chest x-ray.  Pneumothorax would cause an area without lung markings, bordered by a visceral pleural line.

May present with hypotension and decreased breath sounds; however, it would cause bloody chest tube drainage and pleural effusion on chest x-ray.

Although **tube thoracostomy** is often sufficient to manage hemothorax, some patients (up to 15%) require **emergent thoracotomy** for extreme bleeding, including those with:

- **Initial bloody output >1,500 mL** (as in this patient)
- Persistent hemorrhage: >200 mL/hr for >2 hours, or continuous need for blood transfusion to maintain hemodynamic stability

Clamping the chest tube is not recommended; blocking the outflow of blood does not staunch the bleeding (the capacity of the hemithorax is too great), and accumulated intrathoracic blood negatively impacts respiratory mechanics (eg, restricted lung expansion).

Hemothorax may result from injuries to larger intrathoracic structures (eg, aorta, hilar vessels) and/or smaller structures (eg, lung parenchyma, internal mammary or intercostal blood vessels). Each hemithorax can hold up to 40% of the circulating blood volume, and massive hemothorax (>1,500 mL) can present with signs of hemorrhagic shock and tracheal deviation from mass effect (as in this patient). **Tube thoracostomy** should be performed, with immediate bloody drainage of >20 mL/kg (~1,500 mL) being an indication for emergent surgical thoracotomy.



#### Pulmonary Embolism
Trauma causes an inflammatory state that increases the risk of pulmonary embolism. 

#### Blunt Thoracic Aortic Injury (BTAI)
Blunt chest trauma can transmit stretching, shearing, and torsional forces capable of tearing the aorta, which (if the tear is full-thickness) may cause massive hemothorax and hemorrhagic shock.  However, this typically occurs after a more severe mechanism of rapid deceleration (eg, fall >3 m [10 ft], motor vehicle collision), and the aortic isthmus (rather than the ascending aorta) is the most commonly affected site.  Ascending aortic involvement would likely have additional findings such as acute coronary syndrome, cardiac tamponade, or focal neurologic deficits (from cerebrovascular ischemia).

Complete aortic rupture (ie, full-thickness tearing through intimal, medial, and adventitial layers) typically results in rapid exsanguination and death prior to hospital arrival. However, incomplete rupture (ie, adventitia still intact) may allow patients to survive long enough to receive medical attention. Likewise, patients with a complete rupture contained by a hematoma or surrounding tissues (as likely occurred in this patient) may survive the initial injury but require expedient evaluation and management to prevent rebleeding. They will likely be in hemorrhagic shock (hypotension, collapsed neck veins, pale and cool extremities).

Although external signs of blunt chest trauma (eg, bruising, steering wheel imprint) are concerning for BTAI, there are no clinical findings specific for aortic injury. Chest x-ray findings suggestive of BTAI include a **widened mediastinum**, abnormal (eg, enlarged) aortic contour, and/or **left-sided effusion due to hemothorax** (which explains this patient's diminished breath sounds on the left). Concomitant injuries (eg, rib fractures) may be present. Diagnosis of BTAI can be confirmed via CT angiography for hemodynamically stable patients or transesophageal echocardiography (likely in the operating room) for unstable patients. Although hemodynamic support (eg, fluids, blood products) is indicated in hypotensive patients, systolic blood pressure is generally kept at <100 mm Hg to prevent injury extension and rebleeding while awaiting **emergent operative repair**.

#### Esophageal rupture

 may allow efflux of esophageal air into surrounding tissues, potentially resulting in pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax.  However, the quantity and rapidity of leaked air in esophageal rupture is significantly less than with bronchial rupture.

#### Diaphragmatic Injury

**Diaphragmatic Dysfunction**

Unilateral diaphragmatic dysfunction due to phrenic nerve injury or traumatic diaphragmatic rupture can present with tachypnea, shallow breathing, and unilateral diminished breath sounds (due to decreased lung expansion). 

**Diaphragmatic Rupture**

Diaphragmatic rupture can occur after **blunt thoracoabdominal trauma** (eg, motor vehicle collision) due to a sudden and unequal increase in thoracoabdominal pressure, resulting in tears or avulsion. The left diaphragm is more prone to injury than the right due to congenital weakness in the diaphragm's left posterolateral region and the liver's protective effects on the right side. Some patients (especially children) with traumatic diaphragmatic injury may initially have no symptoms and can **present months to years later** after progressive expansion of the diaphragmatic defect.

Due to the mass effect of the abdominal organs in the thorax, symptoms may be related to **lung compression** (eg, chest discomfort, dyspnea), and chest x-ray may show **bowel loops within the thoracic cavity** and **mediastinal shift**. Delayed diagnosis is also associated with increased risk of hernia formation and bowel strangulation, which can be fatal. Diaphragmatic rupture presents on chest x-ray with loss of diaphragmatic contour and/or presence of abdominal organs within the thoracic cavity. with migration of abdominal organs into the hemithorax can cause mass-effect compression of the lung, potentially compromising oxygenation.  However, chest x-ray typically shows abdominal viscera above the diaphragm and/or loss of the diaphragmatic contour.

Traumatic diaphragmatic rupture can cause diaphragmatic dysfunction and abdominal content herniation into the thorax, which can present with decreased breath sounds (due to unilateral hypoventilation) and tracheal deviation (due to mass effect). However, because it does not typically cause significant bleeding, diaphragmatic rupture would be very unlikely to cause refractory hypotension and tachycardia, which are more suggestive of hemorrhagic shock in this patient.

 Although this patient's x-ray findings suggest diaphragmatic injury, **CT scan of the chest and abdomen** is performed because it is more sensitive and is the definitive diagnostic modality. Surgical repair is indicated after the diagnosis is confirmed, and CT scan aids in planning of operative approach (eg, thoracotomy vs laparotomy).

Diaphragmatic rupture should be suspected in patients with prior blunt thoracoabdominal trauma and abnormal chest x-ray findings (eg, bowel loops in the thorax, mediastinal shift). Delayed presentations can occur after progressive expansion of the diaphragmatic defect and abdominal organ herniation. CT scan of the chest and abdomen confirms the diagnosis.

#### Splenic Injury

Splenic injury, one of the most common intraabdominal complications of blunt abdominal trauma (BAT), should be suspected in any patient with BAT and evidence of hemorrhage. It presents with evidence of hemorrhage (eg, tachycardia), along with left upper quadrant (LUQ) pain and left shoulder pain that is likely referred (from blood irritating the phrenic nerve). 

If operative intervention is required, every effort should be made to repair rather than remove the spleen, especially in children.  If removal is unavoidable, postoperative immunization against encapsulated bacteria is mandatory.

Hemodynamically stable patients with a negative ultrasound evaluation but high-risk features should undergo CT imaging.

Contrast angiography (with embolization) is sometimes used for BAT patients with intraabdominal hemorrhage due to splenic or hepatic laceration.  However, this is only appropriate for hemodynamically stable patients with isolated, lower-grade injuries (typically identified by CT scan).

- Displaced, left-sided lower Rib Fracture
- tachycardia is concerning for early hemorrhagic shock
- left shoulder pain (with normal neuromuscular examination) is concerning for referred pain from the left diaphragm; Because of the intimate association between the diaphragm and splenic capsule, a contained splenic bleed can present with referred left shoulder pain prior to the onset of more significant abdominal symptoms.
- Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) is a reasonable next step; however, if the suspicion for intraabdominal injury is high, CT scan should be performed whether or not FAST detects free fluid.
- solid organ (eg, liver, spleen, kidney) injuries are typically not visible on plain abdominal x-ray; suspicion of intraabdominal organ injury should prompt **CT scan of the abdomen**, provided that the patient is not hemodynamically unstable (ie, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg). The use of **IV contrast** better visualizes solid organ injury and potentially detects contrast "blush" (extravasation) at the site of bleeding.

#### Fat embolism

Fat embolism syndrome can occur following fracture of large, marrow-containing bones (eg, femur, pelvis). Patients classically have the triad of respiratory distress, neurologic dysfunction, and a petechial rash; however, the rash is present in less than half of cases.

 may occur with trauma, especially with long bone and pelvic fractures.  Although it may cause hypoxemia, fat embolism classically has associated neurologic abnormalities and a petechial rash.  In addition, it typically **takes 24-72 hours to manifest** following the traumatic insult.

Tachypnea and hypoxemia in the setting of femur fracture are concerning for fat embolism. However, patients with fat embolism classically have accompanying neurological abnormalities and petechial rash, as well as a latency period of 12-72 hours after the initial injury.

| **Fat embolism syndrome**  |                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Etiology**               | Fracture of marrow-containing bone (eg, femur)Orthopedic surgeryPancreatitis |
| **Clinical presentation**  | 24-72 hours following inciting eventClinical triadRespiratory distressNeurologic dysfunction (eg, confusion)Petechial rash |
| **Diagnosis**              | Based on clinical presentation                               |
| **Prevention & treatment** | Early immobilization of fractureSupportive care (eg, mechanical ventilation) |

This patient most likely has **fat embolism syndrome (FES)**. The condition can occur **24-72 hours following fracture** or surgical manipulation of bones that contain abundant marrow (eg, femur, pelvis). The marrow, consisting of fat and hematopoietic cells, embolizes into the venous circulation and can cause physical obstruction in the pulmonary capillaries. Some of the emboli may pass through the pulmonary circulation to cause **microvascular occlusion** in the systemic circulation (eg, brain, dermal capillaries). The circulating fat globules likely also induce a **systemic inflammatory response** that further contributes to microvascular dysfunction.

Patients with FES classically have the **triad** of **respiratory distress** (eg, tachypnea, hypoxemia), **neurologic dysfunction** (eg, confusion), and a **petechial rash**; however, the rash is present in less than half of cases. Thrombocytopenia may occur due to platelet adherence and aggregation to circulating fat globules. Patients typically develop pulmonary edema (mimicking acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) after 24-48 hours, evidenced in this patient by bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT. No pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen because the emboli obstruct the pulmonary capillaries and are too small to be detected on CT.



### Penetrating Injury

**Hypovolemic shock** (ie, severe hypotension, tachycardia, flat neck veins) in the setting of **penetrating chest trauma** (ie, stab to chest) is attributed to **hemorrhage** until proven otherwise; trauma primary survey should seek to identify sources of bleeding. 

Note that a small external wound can conceal extensive internal injury. 

- Central penetrating wounds inside "the box"—delineated superiorly by the clavicles, inferiorly by the costal margins, and laterally by the nipples—are particularly dangerous because of the underlying heart and mediastinal structures. 
- However, even lateral wounds can cause significant injury, including **massive hemothorax** (>1,500 mL) from laceration of underlying lung parenchyma or intercostal vessels.

**Management**

1. Consider both intrathoracic and intraabdominal injuries

   - the diaphragm and intraabdominal contents can rise as high as approximately the fourth thoracic dermatome (ie, nipple level) on expiration.

2. look for intra-thoracic sources of shock

   Presents with: diminished breath sounds on the side of the stab wound led to tube thoracostomy with significant bloody output, thereby identifying the hemorrhage source as intrathoracic.

   - Cardiac tamponade: pericardial effusion
     - it can be visualized on transthoracic echocardiography and treated with pericardiocentesis. 
     - severe hypotension and tachycardia, it classically causes elevated jugular venous pressure with distended neck veins.
   - Hemothorax: unequal breath sounds, pleural effusion
   - Hemomediastinum: 

3. look for intra-abdominal sources of shock

   - Immediate exploratory laparatomy if
     - Hemodynamic instability (SBP <90 mmHg, refractory to initial crystalloid resuscitation)
     - On-going bleeding (frank blood in NG tube or rectum)
     - Peritonitis (e.g. rigidity, rebound tenderness)
     - Evisceration (i.e. externally exposed intestines)
     - Impalement
   - If no immediate laparatomy required and consider laparatomy if imaging (contrast-enhanced CT Abdo) or local wound exploration indicate evidence of:
     - Peritoneal penetration 
     - Significant organ injury
   - If no need to proceed to laparatomy, closely observe patients with serial abdominal examinations

When a patient already has an indication for laparotomy, the abdominal portion of the Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma examination is not necessary as it does not change management.  However, it is sometimes performed in practice (eg, immediately following the cardiac portion) because a positive result (ie, intraperitoneal free fluid) further confirms the need for laparotomy.



### Burns

#### Management of Burns

Initial management

- The initial management of **burn injuries** is identical to the management of all trauma patients: airway, breathing and circulation must always be secured first. 
- Burn patients are at **high risk for respiratory compromise** because the supraglottic airway, which efficiently exchanges heat with inhaled air, is very susceptible to direct thermal injury and acute obstruction by edema and blistering. (In contrast, the subglottic airway is protected from injury by reflexive closure of the vocal cords upon exposure to extremely hot air.)

**In burn patients, clinical indicators of thermal inhalation injury to the upper airway and/or smoke inhalation injury to the lungs include burns on the face, singeing of the eyebrows, oropharyngeal inflammation/blistering, oropharyngeal carbon deposits, carbonaceous sputum, stridor, carboxyhemoglobin level >10%, or history of confinement in a burning building**. The presence of ≥1 of these indicators warrants early intubation to prevent upper airway obstruction by edema.

Clinical indicators of thermal and smoke inhalation injury include:

- Burns on the face
- **Singeing of the eyebrows**
- **Oropharyngeal inflammation**
- Blistering or carbon deposits
- Carbonaceous sputum
- Stridor
- Carboxyhemoglobin level **>10%**
- History of confinement in a **burning building**.  

All burn victims should be treated initially with **high-flow oxygen** via a non-rebreather mask, although caregivers should maintain a **low threshold for intubation** in any patient with physical evidence of thermal damage to the upper airway. A key reason for early intubation is that **progressive airway edema** may preclude intubation later in the patient's clinical course, potentially necessitating an emergent surgical airway.

Caution

- High-dose corticosteroids are not used in the acute treatment of burn wounds. The diabetogenic and immunosuppressive effects of systemic steroids make them contraindicated in severely burned patients, who are already at high risk for metabolic derangement and immunosuppression as a result of their injuries.
- While burn patients are at high risk for infection, especially by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, treatment in the acute setting should focus on restoration of airway, breathing and circulation. Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated in the acute management.
-  Fluid restriction is never indicated in burn patients. Following severe thermal burns, patients require significant volume replacement to compensate for fluid lost through their wounds as well as for a potential injury-related systemic inflammatory response (shock).
-  N-acetylcysteine is the antidote for acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. It is also used as a mucolytic agent in cystic fibrosis. There are case reports to suggest that this agent may also be of value in treating carbon monoxide poisoning, however this intervention would always come second to airway protection by intubation.

May not be able to find a place to measure SpO2 because of the burns on the body surface.

#### Fluid Status

Severe burn injuries often result in rapid development of intravascular volume depletion and shock due to both insensible fluid loss (due to decreased skin integrity) and massive fluid shift into the extravascular space (due to increased vascular permeability).  Patients with extensive burns require aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain tissue perfusion and reduce mortality.  

Isotonic crystalloid solution (eg, normal saline, lactated Ringer solution [LR]) can be used for fluid resuscitation. Lactated Ringer solution, a balanced fluid, is preferred because it contains near-physiologic levels of electrolytes and includes a buffer that helps correct acidosis and maintain normal blood pH.  Normal saline is associated with the development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (and hypocoagulability).

#### Wound infections

Severe burns disrupt the skin barrier and create an avascular, immunologically poor, protein-rich substrate for the growth and proliferation of bacteria and fungus.  
- Immediately after a severe burn, gram-positive organisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) from hair follicles and sweat glands dominate; 
- After more than 5 days, most infections are due to gram-negative organisms (eg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or fungi (eg, Candida).

Wound infections are common, and patients with large surface area (>20%) burns are at highest risk.  
- The earliest sign is usually a change in appearance (partial-thickness injury turns into a full-thickness injury) of the wound or the loss of a viable skin graft.  
- Burn wound sepsis can develop rapidly and is associated with some or all of the following systemic findings:
  - Temperature <36.5 C (97.7 F, as in this patient) or >39 C (102.2 F)
  - Progressive tachycardia (>90/min)
  - Progressive tachypnea (>30/min)
  - Refractory hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg)
- Oliguria, unexplained hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and mental status changes are also common.  

Diagnosis 
- quantitative wound culture (>105 bacteria/g of tissue) 
- biopsy for histopathology (to determine tissue invasion depth).  

Treatment 
- empiric, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (eg, piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenem) 
- with the addition of potential coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (eg, vancomycin) or multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eg, an aminoglycoside). 
- Local wound care and debridement are usually necessary.



### Cervical Spine Trauma

After a high cervical spine injury, patients are at risk for immediate diaphragmatic paralysis because the diaphragm is innervated by cervical nerve roots from C3-C5.  However, if the spinal cord is injured lower than C5, a delayed diaphragmatic paralysis may occur (as in this patient) due to ascending edema.

As in all trauma patients, primary survey includes assessment of the airway (in addition to breathing and circulation).  In patients with impending respiratory failure, the best next step in management is orotracheal intubation, even with evidence of an unstable cervical spine injury, because this procedure can be rapidly performed and is relatively noncomplex.  Typically, this is done with manual stabilization of the cervical spine to minimize neck movement during intubation.



### Traumatic Amputation

Optimal care of the amputated part during transport improves the chances of replantation success.

Care of an amputated part, regardless of the level of injury (eg, digit, hand, forearm), begins with gentle removal (eg, saline irrigation) of gross contamination (eg, sawdust, debris).  Following this, the part should be wrapped in sterile saline-moistened gauze and sealed in a plastic bag.  The bag should be then placed in a container of ice water to be transported with the patient.  Cooling of the amputated part decreases tissue metabolism and oxygen demand, thereby minimizing ischemic damage and prolonging the window of viability for replantation.  An ice water bath (temperature ~0 C [32 F]) provides adequate cooling while minimizing the risk of frostbite, which can occur if the amputated part, or even the bag containing the part, is placed directly on ice. The amputated part should be kept moist, rather than open to air, to prevent desiccation of the exposed tissues, which can cause further tissue damage.

The amputated part should be kept moist but should not remain submerged in any solution during transport.  Prolonged submersion in water can injure digital vessels, making microsurgical vessel repair more difficult or impossible.  Prolonged submersion in antiseptic solution can cause chemical injury.  Instead, to decrease infection risk, the amputated part should be thoroughly cleansed (eg, saline irrigation) and prepped (eg, betadine) at the same time in the operating room prior to attempted replantation.




Pre-surgical Evaluation and Patient Preparations
------------------------------------------------

### Thrombophilia

#### Screening for Inherited Thrombophilia

Although there are no absolute indications for screening for inherited thrombophilias, expert opinion on which patients are likely to benefit from such investigations includes patients with one of the following:

-   Initial thrombosis occurring prior to age 50 without an immediately identified risk factor (e.g., idiopathic or unprovoked venous thrombosis).

-   A family history of venous thromboembolism.

-   Recurrent venous thrombosis.

-   Thrombosis occurring in unusual vascular beds such as portal, hepatic, mesenteric, or cerebral veins.

There is currently no evidence to support any change in outcome when using such a strategy.

### Smoking

Cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk of perioperative pulmonary complications. Smoking cessation has been shown to reduce the risk of both pulmonary and overall surgical complications. However, the benefit is present only when cessation occurs >4-8 weeks prior to surgery, perhaps because the airway inflammation and increased mucus production caused by smoking require several weeks to improve.




Procedures
--------------

### Lung Resection

Indications for lung resection include malignancy, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and persistent infection despite medical treatment.  An important consideration prior to lung resection is whether the patient has enough pulmonary reserve to maintain adequate lung function following surgery.  FEV1 and diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), obtained by preoperative pulmonary function testing, are the best predictors of postoperative outcomes following lung resection surgery.

Based on preoperative FEV1 and DLCO measurements, the percentage of planned lung resection (eg, approximately 50% in unilateral pneumonectomy) is used to estimate postoperative FEV1 and DLCO.  Patients with an estimated postoperative FEV1 or DLCO of <40% are at elevated risk of postoperative morbidity.

### Endotracheal Tube Placement

End-tidal CO2 measurement (capnography) is indicative of aerobic metabolism and can be used to monitor correct endotracheal tube placement or to measure the effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

### Maximal Inspiratory Pressure Measurement
Maximal inspiratory pressure (or negative inspiratory force) is a measurement of inspiratory muscle strength.  It is often used to monitor patients with hypoventilation due to neuromuscular disease (eg, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome) and help assess the need for mechanical ventilation.

### Oxygen Saturation During Exercise
Measurement of oxygen saturation during exercise is used to evaluate the need for home supplemental oxygen therapy in patients with COPD.



### Malignant hyperthermia 

is a hypermetabolic state that occurs in response to volatile anesthetics (eg, isoflurane, halothane) or succinylcholine. Due to increased CO2 production, patients have a respiratory and metabolic acidosis; however, malignant hyperthermia causes hyperventilation rather than hypoventilation. In addition, patients typically have muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and tachycardia.

Post-op Complications
---------

### Postextubation laryngeal edema 

could cause hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure; however, patients would be expected to be stridorous, with tachypnea (rather than bradypnea) and tachycardia.

### Delayed emergence** 

Return to consciousness after anesthesia (emergence) typically occurs within 15 minutes of extubation; at a minimum, patients should be responsive with intact protective (eg, gag) reflexes within 30-60 minutes of the last administration of an anesthetic or adjuvant agent (eg, opiate, muscle relaxant). **Delayed emergence** occurs when a patient fails to regain consciousness within the expected window. The etiology is typically multifactorial but generally occurs due to 1 of 3 major causes:

- **Drug effect:** Preoperative drug ingestion (eg, opiates, benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, anticholinergic drugs, antihistamines) may potentiate anesthetic effects. Prolonged anesthesia duration or higher medication doses may also delay emergence.
- **Metabolic disorder:** Common etiologies include hyper- or hypoglycemia, hyper- or hypothermia, hyponatremia, and liver disease.
- **Neurologic disorder:** Intraoperative stroke, seizure (or postictal state), or elevation of intracranial pressure can cause prolonged alterations in mental status.

This patient's arterial blood gas demonstrates acute hypercarbic and hypoxic **respiratory failure** (low pH, elevated pCO2, low pO2) due to **hypoventilation**. In association with the worsening bradypnea and drop in pulse (which were likely initially elevated due to agitation postextubation), this suggests that the patient's delayed emergence is due to a **prolonged medication effect**, possibly potentiated by preoperative drug or alcohol ingestion in this patient with a history of polysubstance abuse. Management of acute respiratory failure includes **ventilatory support** (eg, bag and mask, reintubation); reversal agents (eg, naloxone) may also be indicated.

### Dehiscence of Surgery Wound

These complications are more common in obese patients (as seen in this case), those who are immunocompromised (eg, chronic corticosteroids, cancer), and those with increased intraabdominal straining (eg, excessive lifting, cough).

Postoperative abdominal wounds can be categorized based on fascial involvement:

#### Superficial wound dehiscence
Superficial wound dehiscence is a separation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue with an intact rectus fascia (as seen in this patient).  It typically develops within the **first postoperative week** and occurs secondary to an abnormal subcutaneous fluid build-up (eg, seroma), resulting in a scant serosanguineous fluid drainage.

**Management**
- Patients with a superficial dehiscence and no signs of infection (eg, induration, erythema, purulent drainage) are conservatively managed with regular dressing changes.  These regular changes help with delayed (secondary) closure by removing excessive fluid and closing physiologic dead space, which debrides nonviable tissue and eliminates potential bacterial reservoirs.
- Abdominal binders are not used for superficial dehiscence because they do not improve outcomes.
  
#### Deep or Fascial wound dehiscence 
This involves the rectus fascia (ie, nonintact) and results in exposure of the intraabdominal organs to the external environment.

**Management**
- Fascial dehiscence is a surgical emergency because of the risk of bowel evisceration and strangulation 
- Abdominal binders may be used temporarily in patients with fascial dehiscence (but no evisceration) in preparation for emergency surgery.  

#### Incisional Hernia
Due to breakdown of prior fascial closure

**Risk factors**
- Obesity (elevated intrabdominal pressure)
- Vertical or midline incision
- Poor wound healing (eg, immunosuppression, malnutrition)
- Surgical site infection
- Tobacco smoking

**Clinical features**

Incisional hernias can be associated with acute gastrointestinal symptoms if the hernias become very large (mass effect) or bowel incarceration occurs (higher risk with smaller hernia size).  However, most patients have an asymptomatic abdominal mass (ie, protruding abdominal contents) that slowly enlarges as the fascial defect expands.  The mass may be present when patients lie supine, and discrete fascial edges may be palpable in non-obese patients.  In addition, abdominal mass size increases with Valsalva because greater intraabdominal pressure causes more protrusion through the defect.
- Slowly enlarging abdominal mass at prior surgical incision site
- Abdominal mass that enlarges with Valsalva
- Palpable fascial edges in non-obese patients
- Possible delayed presentation (months-years)

**Diagnosis**
- Clinical
- CT scan of abdomen for unclear anatomy (e.g. surgical repair planning) or there is concern for an acute complication (e.g. bowel incarceration)


### Wound Infections

#### Simple Infections of the surgical wound

In addition to preoperative antiseptic skin preparation and sterile surgical technique, prophylactic antibiotics can help reduce surgical site infections (SSIs).  Administered prior to incision, prophylactic antibiotics reduce the microorganism burden at the surgical site and are indicated when there is a high risk of infection (eg, traumatic wounds) or when infection would cause significant morbidity/mortality (eg, mediastinitis after cardiac surgery).

The specific antibiotic is chosen based on several factors, including the type of surgical wound and its expected degree of microbial contamination:

- Clean – without infection or viscus entry
- Clean-contaminated – with controlled viscus entry
- Contaminated – inflamed, acutely traumatic, or with viscus spillage
- Dirty – infected, necrotic, or fecally contaminated

Cardiac procedures are typically considered clean, and most associated SSIs are due to skin flora.  Therefore, only gram-positive skin flora (eg, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus) coverage is required.  First- and second-generation cephalosporins (eg, cefazolin) typically provide good prophylactic coverage.  However, this patient has a history of a severe IgE-mediated allergic reaction (ie, anaphylactic shock) to penicillin, with which first- and second-generation cephalosporins have structural similarities (ie, shared allergenic epitopes).  Therefore, an alternative antibiotic (eg, vancomycin, clindamycin) with good gram-positive coverage should be selected.

  Azithromycin has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria including atypical bacteria (eg, Mycoplasma, Legionella); it is commonly used for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.  It has inferior coverage against Staphylococcus and is not typically used for SSI prophylaxis.

 Ciprofloxacin has antimicrobial activity against aerobic, enteric, gram-negative bacilli and is used for prophylaxis in some genitourinary procedures.  Metronidazole has antimicrobial activity against anaerobes (eg, Bacteroides, Clostridium) and protozoa (eg, Trichomonas vaginalis) and is used as part of a prophylaxis regimen in some gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and genitourinary procedures.  However, neither antibiotic provides adequate coverage against typical gram-positive skin flora for this cardiac procedure.

  Piperacillin-tazobactam has antimicrobial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa; it is commonly used in broad-spectrum, empiric coverage for severe infections.  However, such broad coverage is unnecessary (following principles of antimicrobial stewardship) for prophylaxis against a narrower spectrum of gram-positive skin flora.  In addition, piperacillin-tazobactam should be avoided given this patient's severe penicillin allergy.

---------

#### Necrotizing fasciitis or abscess 

CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis may be used in patients with suspected necrotizing fasciitis or abscess.  These patients typically have signs of infection (eg, edema, induration, purulent drainage); those with necrotizing fasciitis may also have associated crepitus.  In both cases, treatment is with systemic antibiotics and wound debridement.

#### Sepsis
- Classic cardiovascular changes in the setting of sepsis include hypotension, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, increased cardiac output, and decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.  
- Fever and warm extremities might also be seen. 

### Hypotension

#### Septic shock 

See sepsis.

#### Myocardial Infarction
Risk of myocardial infarction (MI) is increased during the postoperative period
- hypotension and jugular venous distension.
- significant cardiovascular risk factors
- ST elevation, T-wave inversion, or Q waves on ECG

#### Cardiac Tamponade
Cardiac tamponade is a potential cause of obstructive shock, but it would be unlikely to cause sudden ventilation-perfusion mismatching and hypoxemia with clear lungs.

#### Tension pneumothorax 
Tension pneumothorax can cause obstructive shock by cutting off venous return to the right atrium; however, unilaterally absent breath sounds are expected.

### Post-op Respiratory Distress

#### Anesthetic-induced Hypoventilation

Residual effects of general anesthesia can also cause hypoventilation. appear within the first few hours after surgery, often before the patient leaves the perioperative unit. Patient are happy but desaturating.

Low PaO2, low pH, and high PaCO2 are consistent with hypoxemia and primary respiratory acidosis, as would be expected with the hypoventilation that occurs in narcotics overdose. But patients with narcotic overdose are comfortable despite the hypoxemia, so we do not expect to see an increase in RR.

#### Aspiration Pneumonitis

General anesthesia impairs laryngeal defenses, predisposing to aspiration of gastric contents.  Appear within the first few hours after surgery, often before the patient leaves the perioperative unit. Signs and symptoms of aspiration generally include sudden-onset dyspnea, cough, fever, and rhonchi/crackles on examination.

#### Bronchospasm

Bronchospasm is common in the postoperative period, particularly in patients with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma. Wheezing and dyspnea would be expected in addition to hypoxemia.

#### Fat Embolism

Fat embolism is common with serious trauma to the pelvis and long bones (eg, femur).  Although it frequently causes acute respiratory decompensation, it generally presents within 24-72 hours of the injury, does not usually cause lobar infiltrates, and would not be associated with increased secretions.

#### Ventilator-associated pneumonia

**Ventilator-associated pneumonia** (VAP) is defined as pneumonia that develops ≥48 hours after **endotracheal intubation**. It is generally caused by **aspiration** of microorganisms from the **oropharynx or stomach** into the pulmonary parenchyma. Although endotracheal tubes have inflatable cuffs that seal the upper airway to prevent passage of secretions into the lungs, aspiration can still occur due to leakage around the cuff because of supine positioning, pooling of secretions in the subglottal area, or excessive endotracheal tube movement (eg, during patient transport).

**Major risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia**

- Acid suppression (eg, PPI, H2R blocker, antacid)

  Elevated gastric pH allows microorganisms to grow in gastric secretions, which increases the risk of VAP.  Therefore, gastric acid suppression (eg, via proton pump inhibitor) should not be routinely used for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Acid suppression is generally reserved for patients at high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding (eg, thrombocytopenia, a recent gastrointestinal bleed).

- Supine position

- Pooled subglottic secretions

- Paralysis & excessive sedation

- Excessive patient movement while intubated

- Frequent ventilator circuit changes

- Excessive sedation

   Excessive sedation increases the risk of VAP because it prolongs the number of days on mechanical ventilation and suppresses gag reflex. Daily sedation breaks help lower the risk of VAP due to the reduction of time on mechanical ventilation.

**To reduce the risk of VAP**

- **Head of bed elevation at 30-45 degrees** to reduce retrograde movement of gastric secretions
- Continuous or intermittent **suction of subglottic secretions** to prevent pooling above the endotracheal cuff
- **Minimization of patient transport** to prevent movement of the endotracheal tube
- **Limited use of gastric acid inhibitors** (eg, proton pump inhibitor, histamine-2 receptor blockers, antacids) to reduce the burden of microorganisms in gastric secretions



This intubated patient has increased respiratory secretions, worsening oxygenation, fever, tachycardia, and new pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, raising strong suspicion for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a type of hospital-acquired pneumonia that occurs ≥48 hours after intubation.  Most cases arise due to aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric secretions.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a lung infection that typically develops after 2 days of intubation and frequently presents with fever.

VAP is usually suspected when an intubated patient develops several of the following:

New pulmonary infiltrates
Increased respiratory secretions
Signs of worsened respiratory status, such as worsening oxygenation, lower tidal volumes, and increased inspiratory pressure
Systemic signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia

However, no constellation of manifestations conclusively proves VAP (eg, intubated patients often have pulmonary infiltrates on x-ray in the absence of VAP).  Therefore, noninvasive (eg, endotracheal aspiration) or invasive (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage) sampling of the lower respiratory tract is required for confirmation; moderate or heavy growth of ≥1 microorganism is generally diagnostic.



Ventilator-associated pneumonia may occur in patients on assisted ventilation for >48 hours and is a result of impairments in the lungs' natural defenses. Fever and hypoxia are common, and *Pseudomonas* infection must be considered. This patient has not been ventilated for >48 hours and is afebrile, making this diagnosis unlikely.

**Semirecumbent positioning** may lower the risk of ventilator-acquired pneumonia in intubated patients on mechanical ventilation. 



#### Atelectasis
Post op atelectasis is often due to mucus plugging and is associated with worsened oxygenation.  

Airway obstruction (eg, mucus, tumor, foreign body) creates distal air trapping in the alveoli.  Eventually, the trapped air molecules diffuse into the bloodstream; because no additional air can enter the obstructed airway, the alveoli become devoid of matter and collapse.  To occupy the vacated space, mediastinal structures (eg, carina, heart) are pulled toward the atelectasis (assuming the atelectasis is large).  Patients typically present with respiratory distress (eg, dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia) and hypoxemia, and lung examination reveals dullness to percussion and absence of breath sounds in the affected lung area.  Chest x-ray demonstrates opacification of the affected lung area with mediastinal shifting toward the side of opacification.  In addition, rib spacing becomes narrower in the affected hemithorax.

Surgery (under anesthesia) and smoking increase the risk of mucus plugging.  Chest physiotherapy is often useful in preventing mucus plugging and can be used to treat relatively minor atelectasis due to mucus plugging.  Large-volume atelectasis typically requires bronchoscopy to remove the mucus plug.

Atelectasis is one of the most common postoperative pulmonary complications and is particularly common after abdominal and thoracoabdominal surgery. Following such surgeries, pain and changes in lung compliance can cause impaired cough and shallow breathing.  Shallow inhalations limit recruitment of alveoli at the lung bases, and weak cough predisposes to small-airway mucus plugging. This results in hypoxia (low pO2), which stimulates an increase in respiratory rate, causing low pCO2.

Atelectasis can be asymptomatic or manifest as increased work of breathing. It is most likely to occur after the second postoperative night to the fifth postoperative night. Radiologic findings demonstrate loss of lung volume due to the collapse of lung tissue. Adequate pain control, deep-breathing exercises, directed coughing, early mobilization, and **incentive spirometry** decrease the incidence of postoperative atelectasis.

Once atelectasis develops, it can be treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to help open collapsed alveoli. Patients with abundant secretions may benefit from the addition of chest physiotherapy and suctioning. In some cases, atelectasis due to large mucus plugging may require mucus plug removal via bronchoscopy.

Atelectasis is a common postoperative complication that results from shallow breathing and weak cough due to pain. It is most common on postoperative **days 2 and 3** following abdominal or thoracoabdominal surgery.  Adequate pain control, deep-breathing exercises, directed coughing, early mobilization, and **incentive spirometry** decrease the incidence of postoperative atelectasis.

- Prone positioning reduces atelectasis in the posterior lung (where most of the lung mass is located) and is sometimes used to improve oxygenation in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and persistent hypoxemia despite optimal mechanical ventilation settings.

#### Postoperative Pneumonia
Postoperative pulmonary complications are common, particularly in patients with known risk factors. 

Risks: smoking, preexisting pulmonary disease, age >50, thoracic or abdominal surgery, surgery lasting >3 hours, and poor general health

Management
- Prevention
  - Postoperative measures used to decrease the risk of pneumonia are aimed at encouraging lung expansion.  These include incentive spirometry, deep breathing exercises, continuous positive airway pressure, and intermittent positive pressure breathing.  Of these, incentive spirometry has been shown to be the most effective, and is thus the first line preventive measure.
  - Prophylactic antibiotics prior to surgery are only used in patients with evidence of preexisting respiratory infection.  The use of antibiotics in patients without respiratory infection has not been shown to improve outcomes, and may increase the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant pneumonia.
  - Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), like incentive spirometry, promotes lung expansion postoperatively.  However, it is more costly and has a higher rate of complications than incentive spirometry.  For these reasons, CPAP is used only in patients who develop pulmonary complications in spite of incentive spirometry.
  - By controlling pain and encouraging early ambulation, intercostal nerve blocks have shown some efficacy in preventing postoperative pulmonary complications.  The findings have been most pronounced in patients under age 50, and with subcostal incisions.

#### Upper Airway Obstruction
Upper airway obstruction (eg, due to an expanding hematoma with tracheal compression) would cause hypoxemia and respiratory distress; however, stridor is also expected.

#### Pulmonary embolism
Pulmonary embolism may present in the postoperative period with dyspnea and chest pain.
- Massive PE
  - Massive PE is defined as PE complicated by hypotension and/or acute right heart strain.
  - Although dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain are common symptoms of segmental PE, syncope tends to occur only in massive PE.
  - Survival following massive PE is poor, with death often occurring within an hour of the onset of symptoms.  

**Complication**
- Cardiogenic Shock
  - Signs of acute right heart strain: Jugular venous distension on physical examination and right bundle branch block (RBBB) on electrocardiogram (ECG).  
  - Right heart strain progresses rapidly to right ventricular dysfunction, decreased return to the left side of the heart, decreased cardiac output, left heart pump failure, and resultant bradycardia.  
  - This results in cardiogenic shock and causes central nervous system effects, such as the dilated pupils and unresponsive mental status seen in this patient.

**Management**
- Prevention: prophylactic-dose, low-molecular-weight heparin (eg, enoxaparin) lowers the risk of postoperative deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
- If time permits, massive PE can be confirmed with CT pulmonary angiography.  Although echocardiography has poor sensitivity for segmental PE, massive PE often has visible echocardiographic abnormalities that allow for rapid bedside diagnosis. 
- In conjunction with respiratory and hemodynamic support, fibrinolysis is indicated in the treatment of massive PE. However, surgery within the preceding 10 days is a relative contraindication to fibrinolytic therapy.

#### Diaphragmatic Paralysis

Diaphragmatic paralysis may occur as a consequence of phrenic nerve injury from thoracic surgery, cervical manipulation, or tumor compression but is less likely during abdominal surgery. Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is often asymptomatic.  Bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis causes hypoxemia; rapid, shallow breathing; orthopnea; and even respiratory failure.

#### Volume Overload
Although volume overload can increase oxygen requirement and cause pulmonary infiltrates



#### Venous air embolism

This can happen in neurosurgy, central venous catheter manipulation or due to barotrauma associated with positive pressure ventilation.

Clinical manifestation

- suddent onset respiratory distress
- Hypoxemia, obstructive shock, cardiac arrest

Management

- Left lateral decubitus positioning or left lateral Trendelenburg (left lateral decubitus with head down) position, which traps the VAE on the lateral wall of the right ventricle, **preventing RVOT obstruction and further embolization** of air into the pulmonary circulation.
  - Do not place patient in right lateal decubitus position, as it is likely to encourage movement of air into the RVOT and may worsen the clinical manifestations of VAE.
- **High-flow oxygen** (or, in severe cases, hyperbaric oxygen) is also important as it shrinks the air embolus by encouraging the absorption of nitrogen gas into the blood.

#### Arterial air embolism

- Patients with suspected arterial (rather than venous) air embolism should be placed in **supine positioning**, as it helps prevent the embolism from traveling to the brain and causing a stroke.

### Post-op Altered Mental Status

#### Post-op Ischemic Stroke
Confusion and slurred speech
blood pressure is typically elevated with ischemic stroke

#### Post-op encephalopathy 
It is most commonly associated with cardiac surgery and presents with delirium and/or seizures in the immediate postoperative period.

#### Opioid Intoxication
Opioids may be used for postoperative pain.  However, this patient does not exhibit symptoms of opioid intoxication such as slurred speech, sedation, or respiratory depression.

#### Postoperative Delirium

#### Medication-induced Post-op Delirium

#### Infection-induced Post-op Delirium

Infection (eg, pneumonia) may also precipitate delirium, the patient is usually febrile and has localized symptoms or findings on physical examination (eg, no crackles on lung examination) that would indicate a localized infection. 

#### Benzodiazepine Withdrawal
Withdrawal can occur if a patient who has a history of prolonged use of benzodiazepines does not receive continued medication therapy on admission to the hospital.  In severe cases, benzodiazepine withdrawal can result in seizures.

Watch out for this in patients with psychiatric history consistent with a prescription of benzodiazepines (eg, for anxiety, insomnia).

Benzodiazepine withdrawal may be characterized by agitation, tremors, perceptual changes, psychosis (e.g. hallucination), elevated vital signs (eg, hypertension, tachycardia), delirium, and seizures. 

Benzodiazepines, like alcohol, exert their inhibitory effects via GABA receptors, and their sudden withdrawal leads to an excitatory state.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms within 24-48 hours; withdrawal symptoms from long-acting benzodiazepines may develop over a more protracted period.  Treatment of withdrawal includes reinitiation of benzodiazepines (usually a long-acting agent) that can then be gradually tapered down over weeks to months (and discontinued if necessary).

#### Delirium Tremens
Delayed onset (>48 hours) of severe delirium, elevated vital signs (eg, hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia), and diaphoresis in the setting of known multiple substance use disorders is consistent with a diagnosis of delirium tremens (DT)
DT does not present before 48 hours after the last drink, but symptoms may take as long as 96 hours to be seen.  These symptoms may persist for up to 5 days and are associated with a mortality rate of up to 5%.

Breast Surgery
--------------
Palpable breast masses are common in adolescents and women age <30, especially immediately prior to menses due to estrogen stimulation.  The ideal time to examine the breast is 5-10 days after menses (eg, follicular phase) when hormonal stimulation is minimal.  Some masses may be re-evaluated in the next menstrual cycle if not well palpated in the luteal phase.

### Approach to Breast Mass
Although reassurance and reevaluation after 1 or 2 menstrual cycles (not 6 months) are appropriate for adolescents, all palpable breast masses in adult women require further evaluation (eg, imaging, possible biopsy) due to the increasing risk of breast cancer with age. 

A palpable breast mass may be evaluated using the "triple diagnostic" (clinical breast examination, imaging studies, biopsy) approach, based on the patient's age and risk factors for breast cancer.
- If the patient is below 30 year old, do U/S &pm; mammogram
    - If simple cyst: needle aspiration if patient desires
    - Complex cyst / mass: image-guided core biopsy
- If patient is above 30 year old, do mammogram &pm; U/S
  - If suspicious for malignancy, perform core biopsy

Because history and physical examination alone are insufficient for breast cancer evaluation, all breast masses in women age <30 require evaluation with ultrasonography.  Ultrasonography can help in the assessment of cancer risk based on the composition and characteristics of the mass.  Patients with a symptomatic, simple breast cyst can undergo fine-needle aspiration for pain relief.  Further management depends on the results of the fine-needle aspiration:

If the aspirated fluid is clear (ie, not bloody) and the breast mass resolves completely, patients are at low risk for cancer and may undergo observation with a repeat breast examination in 4-6 weeks (Choice D).
In contrast, if the fluid is bloody or the mass does not resolve (ie, remains palpable), patients are at increased risk for breast cancer and require core needle biopsy, which can provide a definitive histologic diagnosis.

reast MRI is used for screening in high-risk patients (eg, BRCA carrier) or assessing for metastatic disease in patients with diagnosed breast cancer.  It is not used for evaluating a new breast mass because breast MRI has high sensitivity but low specificity for cancer (ie, both benign and malignant masses appear enhanced).



### Benign breast condition

Diagnosis |  Clinical features
|---|----
Breast cyst | Solitary, well-circumscribed, mobile mass ± Tenderness
Fibroadenoma| Solitary, well-circumscribed, mobile mass; Cyclic premenstrual tenderness; <br> Large, growing fibroadenomas may require lumpectomy for symptomatic relief, but a fine needle or core biopsy should be performed first to confirm the diagnosis.
Fibrocystic changes|Multiple, diffuse nodulocystic masses, Cyclic premenstrual tenderness
Fat necrosis | Post trauma/surgery; Firm, irregular mass; ± Ecchymosis, skin/nipple retraction
Galactocele | A galactocele is a milk-retention cyst resulting from a plugged duct, usually due to cessation of breastfeeding

#### Cysts and Fibroadenomas
Small size, regular texture, round shape, and mobility characterize a benign process presenting as a breast cyst (eg, soft, fluid-filled, mobile structure) or fibroadenoma (eg, firm, solid, mobile mass).  Both cysts and fibroadenomas may increase in size with estrogen use (eg, combined oral contraceptives) and are associated with premenstrual discomfort.  These benign structures may occur anywhere in the breast but are usually in the upper outer quadrants.

#### Fat Necrosis
This benign condition is associated with breast surgery (eg, breast reduction/reconstruction) and trauma (eg, seatbelt injury).  Fat necrosis can mimic breast cancer in its clinical and radiographic presentation because it commonly presents as a fixed mass with skin or nipple retraction and gives the appearance of calcifications on mammography.  Ultrasonography can demonstrate a hyperechoic mass, which often correlates with a benign etiology.  Biopsy is diagnostic and typically shows fat globules and foamy histiocytes.

Despite benign biopsy results, the entire mass is often excised due to concerning findings of calcifications on mammography and a fixed irregular mass on clinical examination.  Once the diagnosis is confirmed with pathologic analysis, routine annual screening is sufficient as the risk of breast cancer is not increased.

#### Mastalgia

Ice packs and a supportive bra are indicated in the management of breast pain (ie, mastalgia).  Patients with mastalgia have bilateral breast pain with no associated mass.

Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) can cause breast pain, particularly in the first few months after initiation, but they do not typically cause breast cysts.  Therefore, patient with benign breast cyst does not need to discontinue her COCs.

#### Mastitis and Breast Abscess

Overview: Breast abscesses present with a unilateral fluctuant, tender, palpable breast mass with fever, surrounding erythema/pain, and associated axillary lymphadenopathy.  Management includes drainage (eg, needle aspiration) and empiric antibiotics (eg, dicloxacillin, cephalexin).

breast abscess based on the presence of signs of mastitis (fever, localized erythema/pain) accompanied by a unilateral fluctuant, tender, palpable mass.  Breast abscesses typically develop from untreated mastitis (as seen in this patient), which is typically due to incomplete emptying of the breast (eg, poor latch, alternating of breast and bottle feeds) and resultant milk stasis.  In turn, persistent or severe mastitis can lead to a focal collection of purulent fluid (abscess).  Mastitis and breast abscess are typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which enters the breast through nipple trauma (eg, chafing/blistering).

The diagnosis of breast abscess is made clinically, but ultrasound may be required to differentiate severe mastitis from an abscess if a mass is deep within the tissue.  Management includes drainage of the abscess with either needle aspiration (usually under ultrasound guidance) or incision and drainage.  Empiric antibiotics against methicillin-sensitive S aureus (eg, dicloxacillin, cephalexin) are added for treatment of the surrounding mastitis.  Continued breastfeeding is recommended for continued milk drainage.

Breast binding is not recommended for breast engorgement, mastitis, or abscess because it increases pain and facilitates ductal blockage.

#### Clogged lactiferous ducts

 Warm compresses and massage are indicated in the management of a clogged lactiferous duct, which can present with unilateral breast pain; however, the mass is typically located in the subareolar region and has no associated axillary lymphadenopathy.

### Breast Carcinoma
An irregular, fixed mass along with nipple discharge and/or lymphadenopathy are concerning features of malignancy.  

An intraductal papilloma presents with bloody or serosanguineous nipple discharge.  Breast examination may show no palpable mass or a small (eg, <1 cm) palpable mass adjacent to the nipple.

Core needle and skin punch biopsies are indicated in the evaluation of inflammatory breast cancer, which can present similar to mastitis or abscess (eg, unilateral breast pain, axillary lymphadenopathy).  Patients typically have peau d'orange skin thickening and a solid (rather than fluctuant) mass.

### Small-bowel Obstruction

Clinical presentation
-  Colicky abdominal pain, vomiting
-  Inability to pass flatus or stool if complete (no obstipation if partial)
-  Hyperactive → absent bowel sounds
-  vomiting and abdominal distension due to backup of gastric secretions and intestinal gas
-  Colicky pain after meals is also common due to unproductive bowel peristalsis against the obstruction, with hyperactive bowel sounds in the early stages.

Risk factors
-  In the setting of recent surgery and a tender, palpable mass at the level of the incision, the obstruction is likely caused by an incisional hernia.  Incisional hernias can develop at the site of any abdominal incision and reflect a breakdown in fascial closure.  Obesity appears to be an important risk factor.  Although most cases present as an asymptomatic abdominal mass, obstruction can occur, particularly with smaller hernias, because bowel can remain trapped within the small fascial defect.

Diagnosis
- Dilated loops of bowel with air-fluid levels on plain film or CT scan
- Partial: air in colon
- Complete: transition point (abrupt cutoff), no air in colon

Complications
- Ischemia/necrosis (strangulation)
- Bowel perforation

Management

SBO treatment depends on disease severity.  Partial SBO, in which the bowel lumen is narrowed but not completely obstructed, typically improves with conservative management (ie, bowel rest, nasogastric tube insertion for bowel decompression, serial abdominal examinations).

In contrast, those with a complete SBO (no flatus, no air in the rectum on x-ray), such as this patient, are at increased risk of life-threatening complications (eg, bowel ischemia, perforation) that will not resolve with conservative management (Choice C).  Therefore, in addition to nasogastric tube insertion for gastric decompression, these patients require emergency laparotomy to relieve the obstruction and resolve any underlying etiology (eg, incisional hernia, intraabdominal adhesions).

- Bowel rest, nasogastric tube suction
- intravenous fluids
- Surgical exploration for signs of complications

### Intussusception
