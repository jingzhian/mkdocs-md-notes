Kidney Diseases
---------------

### Renal Artery Stenosis

Patients with renal artery stenosis are largely asymptomatic, but as the kidney function deteriorates, they may experience edema and dyspnea. On physical examination, patients will have hypertension (as a consequence of elevated angiotensin II and aldosterone) and possibly abdominal bruits. For laboratory studies, the patient will have elevated serum angiotensin II and serum aldosterone, as the kidneys attempt to compensate for a perceived decrease in glomerular filtration rate.

### Acute Kidney Injury

### Chronic Kidney Disease

### Diabetic Kidney Disease

### Polycystic Kidney Diease

### Renal Cancer

Urinary Tract Diseases
----------------------

### Urinary Tract Infection

#### Asymptomatic Bacteriuria

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is very common in older patients. There is no evidence that treating it helps. As many as 50% of older men will have a positive urine culture within six weeks of treatment for a UTI. As such, there is no need for a test of cure. If an older patient has a UTI, and then has similar symptoms again, he will need a urine culture at that point.

### Urinary Tract Obstruction

Prostate Conditions
-------------------

#### Prostatitis

Can cause referred LBP in men.

(Pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis in women can cause referred LBP).

Expect to find evidence of infection in the history.

presentation

-   tend to occur in young and middle-aged males. The symptoms of prostatitis include pain (in the perineum, lower abdomen, testicles and penis, and with ejaculation)

-   may present with lower back pain in old men

-   associated with malaise, chills, heistancy (bladder outlet obstruction), dysuria (bladder irritation), and sometimes blood in the semen.

physical exam

-   PE: vital signs suggestive of SIRS, look for costovertebral angle tenderness, do digital rectal exam

-   Labs: Urinalysis, PSA,

#### Benign Prostate Hyperplasia

-   Presentation

    -   Old man

    -   Bladder outflow obstruction (BOO)

        -   Early: frequency, urgency, nocturia, hesitancy, weak urinary stream, complete bladder empty

        -   Later: overflow incontinence

-   PE

    -   Digital Rectal Exam: rubbery on palpation (in contrast to prostate cancer which is nodular and firm)

-   Dx

    -   Gross: Combination of epithelial and stromal hyperplasia, predominantly in the periurethral and transition zones.

-   Complication

    -   urinary retention increased pressure in urinary tract hypertrophy of bladder walls, hydronephrosis, pressure atrophy of the renal parenchymal chronic renal failure.

    -   UTI

    -   Obstructive nephropathy

-   Management

    -   Behavior modifications to decrease lower urinary tract symptoms:

        -   avoiding fluids prior to bedtime or before going out

        -   reducing consumption of mild diuretics such as caffeine and alcohol

        -   limiting the use of salt and spices

        -   maintaining voiding schedules

        -   Do not take decongestants like Sudafed, antihistamines like Benadryl.

    -   Alpha-adrenergic antagonists decrease urinary symptoms in most males with mild to moderate BPH. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists include tamsulosin, alfuzosin, terazosin and doxazosin. The American Urology Association (AUA) Guidelines Committee believes that all four medications are equally effective.

        -   5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are more effective in males with larger prostates. Their effect on preventing acute urinary retention and reduction in need of surgery require long term treatment for more than a year. There are two 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors approved in the United States: finasteride and dutasteride.

        -   In males with severe symptoms, those with a large prostate (\>40 g), and in those who do not get an adequate response to maximal dose monotherapy with an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, combination treatment with an alpha-adrenergic antagonist and a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor may be desirable.

        Side effect of alpha blockers: feeling tired or sleepy.

    -   In general, if bladder outlet obstruction is creating a risk for upper urinary tract injury such as hydronephrosis, renal insufficiency, or lower urinary tract injury such as urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infection, or bladder decompensation; surgical intervention is needed. Surgery also should be considered if combination treatment fails to improve symptoms of BPH.

Testicular and Penil Conditions
-------------------------------

### Testicular Physical Examinations

#### Scrotal Examination

-   Inspection: look for erythema, swelling, discoloration (blue dot sign - pathognomonic for appendiceal torsion when tenderness is also present), skin integrity, and position of the testicle.

-   Palpation: The skin of the scrotum should be palpated for edema, fluid collection, tenderness, and subcutaneous emphysema. Begin palpation of scrotal contents with the unaffected side. The normal testis is mobile, and the spermatic cord and epididymis are palpable posteriorly.

    1.  By gently grasping the testis between the thumb and first two digits, the testicle is examined from its inferior pole, superiorly.

    2.  Then palpate the testicle for size, tenderness, (localized or diffuse), lie (high or low within scrotum-the left testicle normally sits slightly lower than the right), and axis (horizontal or vertical).

    3.  Tenderness limited to the upper pole of the testis suggests torsion of a testicular appendage, especially when a hard, tender nodule is palpable in this region.

    The epididymis should be examined for size, position, tenderness, and swelling. The epididymis should be palpable as a soft, smooth ridge posterolateral to the testis. To complete the intra-scrotal evaluation, palpation of all scrotal contents should occur. This includes examination of the spermatic cord to the superficial inguinal ring for tenderness or a \"knot\" which suggests testicular torsion and any localized fluid collections, such as a hydrocele or spermatocele.

-   Additional Tests

    -   Cremasteric reflex\
        Cremasteric reflex can be assessed by lightly stroking or pinching the superior medial aspect of the thigh. An intact cremasteric reflex causes brisk ipsilateral testicular retraction. Absence of the cremasteric reflex is a sensitive but non-specific finding for testicular torsion. It can be absent on physical exam in normal testes. It should be assessed after inspection and before palpation of the testicles.

    -   Prehn sign\
        Physical lifting of the testicles relieves the pain caused by epididymitis but not pain caused by testicular torsion

    -   Transillumination\
        A light source shines brightly through a hydrocele.

### Crytorchidism

-   Cx

    -   Poor sperm count: due to heat induced damage

    -   Overtime, seminiferous tubules become atrophic and hyalinized as a result of this temperature induced damage

### Hydrocele

A hydrocele is a cystic painless scrotal fluid collection and is the most common cause of painless scrotal swelling.

Light should be visible through the scrotum when it is illuminated with a strong light source (positive transillumination).

Hydroceles are generally asymptomatic unless associated with trauma or infection, although patients may report a slowly growing mass that causes a pulling or dragging sensation.

### Varicocele

A varicocele is a collection of dilated and tortuous veins in the pampiniform plexus surrounding the spermatic cord in the scrotum.

Varicoceles occur more commonly on the left side (85-95 percent) because the left spermatic vein enters the left renal vein at a 90 degree angle, whereas the right spermatic vein drains at a more obtuse angle directly into the inferior vena cava, facilitating more continuous flow.

Varicocele is seen commonly in adult men but can be seen in adolescents; approximately 10-25 percent of adolescent boys have a varicocele.

One-third of all males presenting to an infertility clinic have a varicocele.

Varicocele is associated with infertility, although the precise mechanism by which this occurs has been the subject of considerable research and is currently thought to be due to increased testicular temperature.

Patients with varicocele can be asymptomatic or may complain of a dull ache or fullness of the scrotum upon standing.

A varicocele is mass-like and nontender or mildly tender to palpation on exam.

### Testicular Torsion

Causes:

Congenital anomaly

A congenital anomaly that results in failure of normal posterior anchoring of the gubernaculum, epididymis, and testis is called a bell clapper deformity because it leaves the testis free to swing and rotate within the tunica vaginalis of the scrotum much like the gong (clapper) inside of a bell, causing an intravaginal torsion. A large mesentery between the epididymis and the testis can also predispose itself to torsion. Contraction of the muscles shortens the spermatic cord and may initiate testicular torsion.

Undescended testes

Although there is little solid evidence, the incidence of testicular torsion is thought to be higher in undescended testes than in normal scrotal testes. Torsion of an undescended testicle often occurs with the development of a testicular tumor, presumably caused by increased weight and distortion of the normal dimensions of the organ.

Recent trauma or vigorous exercise

The patient's history often indicates recent trauma to the genital area, hard physical work, or vigorous exercise.

Testicular torsion can also occur without any apparent reason.

Testicular torsion, in which the testicle rotates around its vascular supply, is the most serious condition under consideration.

Surgical emergency with a limited window of 4 - 12 hours after the onset of pain to save the testicle by untwisting the spermatic cord. Timely diagnosis and treatment are vital for survival of the testis. In order to increase the chances of saving the testis in a testicular torsion, one must seek medical attention and have the testicle detorsed within 6 hours of onset of pain. If the individual waits longer than 6 hours, he increases his chances of losing the testicle and/or impaired fertility.

Most common in neonates and post pubertal boys, with the majority of cases of testicular torsion occurring between the ages of 12-18 years.

Relatively uncommon condition. Each year one in 4,000 men younger than 25 years gets it.

Symptoms: scrotal, inguinal, or lower abdominal pain which usually begins abruptly. The pain is severe, and the patient appears uncomfortable. It can occur several hours after vigorous physical activity or minor testicular trauma and there may be associated nausea and vomiting. There may be prior similar episodes that might suggest intermittent testicular torsion.

Physical findings: swollen, tender scrotum and the cremasteric reflex is typically absent. Testicular torsion causes the orientation of the testis to change, causing a \"transverse lie\" although this may be difficult to appreciate in a very swollen and tender patient.

Diagnosis

-   Color Doppler ultrasonography can confirm testicular torsion if pain is less severe and the diagnosis is in question. If testicular torsion is present, intratesticular blood flow is either decreased or absent which appears as decreased echogenicity, as compared with the asymptomatic testis. In addition, the torsed testicle often appears enlarged.

    Radionuclide scintigraphy is a diagnostic test that uses a radioisotope to visualize testicular blood flow. Patients with testicular torsion have decreased radiotracer in the ischemic testis, resulting in a photopenic lesion.

    Radionuclide scintigraphy vs color doppler ultrasonography:

    Radionuclide scintigraphy procedure has 100% sensitivity, whereas Doppler ultrasonography only has a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 90% in detecting testicular torsion.

    Although scintigraphy may be more sensitive for testicular torsion, ultrasonography is faster and more readily available. This is a critical consideration in a condition that warrants a rapid diagnosis.

    Color Doppler ultrasonography and scintigraphy demonstrate no statistically significant difference in ability to demonstrate testicular torsion in boys with acute scrotal symptoms and indeterminate clinical presentations.

Management

-   Intravenous access

-   sends blood and urine samples

-   Page urologist for surgery

-   2 mg IV morphine for temporary pain relief

-   Non-surgical approach

    Manual detorsion of the torsed testes, may be attempted, but it is usually difficult because of acute pain during the manipulation. This nonoperative distorsion is not a substitute for surgical exploration.

    If the maneuver is successful, orchiopexy (surgical fixation of both testes to prevent retorsion) must still be performed. This should be done in the immediate future, preferably before the patient leaves the hospital.

    If full manual reduction of torsion cannot be performed or if there is doubt about the diagnosis and reason to suspect torsion, the scrotum must be explored.

    Surgical approach

    The testis must be unwound at operation and inspected for viability. If it is not viable, it should be removed. If the testis is viable then orchiopexy should be performed to prevent recurrence. Whether the affected testis is removed or conserved, the contralateral one should undergo orchiopexy as the risk of recurrence on the other side is otherwise high.

-   avoid contact sports for another month, but he can participate in non-contact drills

### Testicular Appendage Torsion

Torsion of the testicular appendages (appendix epididymis and appendix testis) occurs less commonly and is associated with less morbidity than torsion of the testis. Appendix testis is a small vestigial structure (embryonic remnant of Mullerian duct) located on the anterosuperior aspect of the testis.

Typically occurs in younger patients with most cases occurring between the ages of seven and 14 years.

Presents with abrupt onset of pain that is typically less severe than in testicular torsion and is localized to the region of the appendix testis without any tenderness in the remaining areas of the testes.

As in epididymitis, the patient may appear comfortable except when examined.

Presence of a bluish discoloration in the scrotum at the upper pole of the testis (blue dot sign) is produced by testicular appendiceal torsion.

### Epididymtis

Epididymitis is the most frequent cause of sudden scrotal pain in adults.

Symptoms are typically slowly progressive over several days rather than abrupt.

It is caused by bacterial infection of the epididymis, typically from a urinary tract or sexually-transmitted infection.

The patient may appear comfortable except when examined.

Severe swelling and exquisite pain are present on the involved side, often accompanied by high fever, rigors, and irritative voiding symptoms.

Patients may have had preceding symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection or sexually transmitted disease.

On exam, the scrotum is tender to palpation and edematous on the involved side. The cremasteric reflex is usually present, and the testis is in its normal location and position.
