Vascular Heart Diseases
-----------------------

### Coronary Vascular Disease

Risk Factors

-   Major Risk Factors

    -   Unmodifiable: Age, First degree relative with premature coronary heart disease (CHD)

    -   Modifiable: Low HDL (\<40), Diabetes, HTN, Obesity, Smoking, Physical Inactivity

Specific things to note

-   Note that CHD and stroke are together called atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or ASCVD.

-   Most tools for assessing CHD risk is based on data from men, women can present different prodromal symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, neck and jaw pain, palpitations, cough, nausea and vomiting, indigestion, back pain, dizziness, numbness. Women also tend to be less aggressively treated than men and suffer worst outcomes.

Characteristics of someone with chest pain from ischemic heart disease:

-   HPI - substernal, worse with exertion, relieved with NTG

    -   0 - 1: non-anginal

    -   2: atypical anginal

    -   3: typical anginal

-   Risk factors:

    -   Modifiable: diabetic, obese and HLD, smoker with HTN

    -   Non-modifiable: Fm Hx, Age above 45 for male and 55 for female

-   Associated symptom: SOB, presyncope, and N/V increases pretest probability

-   Physical: Non-pleuric, non-positional, non-tender chest pain

Physical

-   Hypercholesteronemia: Xanthelasma

-   Vascular disease: Hypertension, Carotid bruits, Diminished peripheral pulses, Increased abdominal aortic size (the diameter of a normal abdominal aorta should be less than 2 cm)

-   CAD risk: Increased waist circumference (\> 40 inches in males, \> 35 inches in females), Increased waist-to-hip ratio (\> 0.85 for females or \> 0.90 for males)

Management

-   Workup:

    -   Rule out most severe disease, i.e. STEMI using 12 lead EKG; if there is STEMI, go to Cath lab immediately

    -   If not STEMI, get cardiac enzymes, if elevated, do Cath

        -   Troponin peaks first and last (sensitive and specific to the heart); good for brand new heart attack, not for reinfarction

        -   CKMb is good for reinfarction but peak later

        Note: some unstable angina, without cardiac enzyme elevation require Cath

    -   Do stress test (usually next day) - and if there is a problem Cath

        -   Stress: exercise or pharmacology (if unable to exercise) - adenosine / dobutamine

        -   Evaluation: EKG, echo if baseline EKG is abnormal, and nuclear if all else fails.

        The ACC/AHA 2002 Guideline Update for Exercise Testing makes the case that all patients with intermediate risk (i.e. between Â 10 and 80% risk) should undergo exercise treadmill testing (ETT) as the initial diagnostic test for suspected CAD. A major exception to this rule is for patients in whom the baseline ECG is not interpretable (which includes those with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a paced heart rhythm, a left bundle branch block, or more than 1 mm of ST depression at baseline).

    -   Stress echocardiography and nuclear stress testing (either using thallium or sestamibi as the nuclear agent) are also both commonly used in patients with intermediate risk of CAD.

-   Continue daily aspirin, beta-blocker, statin. Consider Catheterization.

-   Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (preventing disease in those without known disease) involves avoiding tobacco, aggressively controlling diabetes mellitus, keeping blood pressure and cholesterol in the normal range, and regular exercise. The USPSTF recommends initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years. For adults aged 60-69 years of age with a 10% or greater 10 year risk of CVD, the decision to use low dose aspirin for primary prevention must be individualized based on each patient's life expectancy and longterm bleeding risk. For patients \< 50 years or \> 70 years, there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of risks versus benefits of daily aspirin use for primary prevention.

    Secondary prevention (preventing further disease in those with known disease) involves avoidance of risk factors, more aggressive cholesterol lowering, and optimizing hypertension and diabetic control. Aspirin and statins are mainstays of secondary prevention for most patients. Certain cardiovascular medications such as beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be used as well, particularly for patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction and/or have reduced ventricular systolic function.

-   Medication

    -   For relief of stable angina symptoms, beta blockers (BBs), calcium channel blockers (CACBs), and nitrates have all been proven to be effective in the treatment of stable angina. These classes of medication may also be useful for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease through their blood pressure lowering effects in patients with hypertension. Long acting formulations of CACBs are recommended for management of stable angina as shorter acting forms have been associated with greater risk of hypotension and reflex tachycardia, both of which can exacerbate anginal symptoms. At least one study comparing short and long acting CACB formulations demonstrated a higher mortality risk with a shorter acting agent. Longer acting nitrates are similarly preferred for chronic angina management as they tend to have a lower risk of hypotension, lightheadedness, and headache which promotes better medication adherence.

    -   In their 2012 guidelines, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) stated their preference of BBs over CACBs and long acting nitrates since BBs have been shown to improve survival rates in patients with CAD. CACBs and long-acting nitrates should be considered when BBs are contraindicated or as additive therapy when BBs alone are not effective in controlled angina.

    -   ACE inhibitors (C) are not directly helpful for the treatment of angina and therefore not recommended for this indication. However, the ACC/AHA does recommend use of ACE inhibitors in patients with ASCVD and concomitant hypertension, diabetes, reduced systolic left ventricular function, or chronic kidney disease, conditions where they have been shown to decrease mortality.

Conductive Heart Dieases / Arrhythmia
-------------------------------------

### Atrial Fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation is rapid, irregular, and chaotic atrial activity without definable p waves on electrocardiogram. Its presence should be suspected in individuals presenting with dizziness, syncope, dyspnea, or palpitations. While palpation of an irregular pulse or auscultation of an irregular heart rate may raise suspicion of atrial fibrillation, the diagnosis requires confirmation with electrocardiogram.

-   Epidemiology\
    Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia physicians face in clinical practice, accounting for about one-third of hospitalizations for arrhythmia. The prevalence of AF increases with age and the severity of congestive heart failure or valvular heart disease. Furthermore, in most cases, AF is associated with the cardiovascular diseases of hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and mitral valve disease. Pulmonary disorders of COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary embolism are associated and predisposing factors. Other associated conditions include surgery, excess alcohol intake, hyperthyroidism, and febrile illnesses.

-   Persistent vs. paroxysmal\

    -   Atrial fibrillation less than **72 hours** total duration would be classified as new onset.

    -   Chronic atrial fibrillation may be either persistent or paroxysmal. In the paroxysmal form, atrial fibrillation may recur and then revert back to normal rhythm spontaneously, with variable periods of normal sinus rhythm between episodes. The presence of normal rhythm does not rule out the existence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. This arrhythmia can occur episodically without clinical detection or significant symptoms for several months.

#### AF with Rapid Ventricular Response

AF with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR) is the presence of physiologic or non-physiologic (electrical) ventricular tachycardia in the presence of AF.

-   Etiology: Fever, myocarditis, pericarditis, volume contraction, thyrotoxicosis, endogenous catecholamines, and AV nodal dysfunction.

-   Complications: In the presence of a diminished cardiac output at baseline, AF with RVR predisposes to hemodynamic instability, functional impairment, heart failure and ischemia.

-   Treatment:

    -   Rate control: Controlling the heart rate with intravenous diltiazem, beta-blockers, or verapamil improves blood flow and does not delay immediate need for emergency stroke treatment.

    -   Rhythm control: Cardioversion either via electric shock to the heart with the patient under sedation or via medications given orally or intravenously. Both methods carry a risk of stroke which is greatest in patients who have had atrial fibrillation for more than 48 hours, or who have not been given three weeks of prior anticoagulant therapy.

#### Prevention of a First Stroke in Patients with AF

There are multiple pharmacologic choices to use to prevent stroke in patient with AF. To make this decision, utilize a risk calculator like CHADS-VASc score to determine if the patient should utilize an anti-platelet versus an anticoagulant to reduce their risk.

-   Adjusted-dose warfarin (target INR, 2.0-3.0)\
    Recommended for all patients with nonvalvular AF deemed to be at high risk and many deemed to be at moderate risk for stroke who can receive it safely (Class I; Level of Evidence A).

-   Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin\
    Recommended for low-risk and some moderate-risk patients with AF on the basis of patient preference, estimated bleeding risk if anticoagulated, and access to high-quality anticoagulation monitoring (Class I; Level of Evidence A).

-   Dual-antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin\
    Offers more protection against stroke than aspirin alone but with an increased risk of major bleeding and might be reasonable for high-risk patients with AF deemed unsuitable for anticoagulation (Class IIb; Level of Evidence B).

-   Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran (Class I; Level of Evidence B), apixaban (Class I; Level of Evidence B), and rivaroxaban (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B) are all indicated for the prevention of first and recurrent stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. These agents have compared favorably to warfarin in some studies, but they can be very expensive and they require careful adherence to prevent lapses in anticoagulant protection.

### Heart Block

Management

-   Remove calcium channel blockers, as these may worsen heart block

Structural Heart Diseases
-------------------------

### Mitral Valve Prolapse

-   Patients are mostly asymptomatic but some can experience CP, SOB, palpitations

-   Characteristically manifest as a mid-systolic click; If associated with systolic murmur, hemodynamically significant regurgitation is present

-   Complications

    -   infective endocarditis

    -   arrhythmia

    -   sudden death

    -   cerebral embolism

### Ruptured Papillary Muscle

-   Usually a complication of IE or MI

-   Lead to mitral or tricuspid regurgitations, not associated with clicks

### Bicuspid Aortic Valve

-   Most frequent type of congenital defect of the aortic valve

-   May manifest with valvular stenosis, giving rise to systolic murmur sometimes with an opening click

Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
---------------------------

Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy has many causes, such as idiopathic, infectious (e.g. viral), toxic (e.g. alcoholic), or infiltrative (e.g. sarcoidosis).

### Dilated Cardiomyopathy

### Hypertrophy Cardiomyopathy

### Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysmorphia

### Restrictive Cardiomyopathy

Functional Heart Diseases {#ssec:cardio-functional}
-------------------------

### Congestive Heart Failure {#sssec:cardio-chf}

Pathophysiology and Symptoms

-   Distinguish between left or right heart failure; most patients will have both but some times we see one of them, e.g. PE, COPD, MI.

-   Right heart symptoms: fluid back up in the periphery, lack of blood get into the lungs or the periphery.

    -   fluid back up in SVC - Jugularvenous distension

    -   fluid back up in IVC, goes through the abdomen first and then falls to the floor - HSM, congestive hepatopathy, peripheral edema,

    -   lack of blood going into the heart - exertional dyspnea

-   Left heart symptoms: lung drowns in excess fluid and lack of blood going to the rest of the body.

    -   fluid in the lungs - crackles in lung bases and dullness to percussion

    -   dyspnea is one of the cardinal manifestations of congestive heart failure (CHF), but is a nonspecific finding. One study found that dyspnea on exertion has a specificity of only 17% for CHF. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) is more closely associated with CHF. Orthopnea, too, is often a symptom of CHF and/or pulmonary edema but can also occur with pulmonary pathology (such as asthma and chronic bronchitis) as well as with sleep apnea or panic disorder. When patients with CHF are recumbent for an extended period, such as at night, peripheral edema is reabsorbed. This increases total blood volume and blood pressure and can lead to pulmonary hypertension in people with underlying left ventricular dysfunction. Pulmonary hypertension leads to pulmonary edema which causes both orthopnea and PND. The absence of these symptoms makes CHF unlikely.

    -   Point of maximal impulse (PMI) that is laterally displaced from the mid-clavicular line towards the axillary line

-   General signs

    -   S3 from rapid ventricular filling or poor left ventricular functioning

Diagnosis

-   BNP - Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) testing can help differentiate heart failure from non-cardiac conditions in patients with dyspnea. A normal BNP effectively rules out CHF. However, an elevated BNP cannot distinguish diastolic from systolic heart failure.

-   2D echocardiogram - ejection fraction and diastolic function are used to determine if we have diastolic or systolic disease

-   Left heart catheter (left ventricular gram) to know if this is ischemic or non-ischemic

-   CXR findings

    -   Cardiomegaly: Defined when the width of the heart is more than half of the width of the thorax.

    -   Central vascular congestion and hilar fullness: Patients in failure frequently have hilar fullness on a PA chest film. Individual vessels may appear enlarged.

    -   Pleural effusions: Identified by a blunting of the costophrenic angles. This can be seen posteriorly on a lateral film as well. Occasionally, prominent fluid in the horizontal fissure will be seen in the right lung.

    -   Cephalization of pulmonary vasculature: Typically, pulmonary vessels are not well seen in the upper lung fields. In CHF, however, they become engorged and can be seen extending from the hilum.

    -   Kerley B lines: These are small linear densities 2-3 cm in length seen in the periphery of the lung fields on the PA view. They represent interstitial fluid in the lung tissue.

Identify a Cause of CHF

-   Ischemic cardiomyopathy\
    Ischemic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of CHF and is most often the result of long-term risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and behavioral factors resulting in significant CAD. Over time, damage to the myocardium and scarring lead to reduced systolic function.

-   Diastolic dysfunction due to uncontrolled hypertension\
    After CAD, the second most common cause of CHD is diastolic dysfunction, often due to uncontrolled hypertension.

-   Myocardial infarction (MI)\
    A recent myocardial infarction can overwhelm cardiac reserve and result in a new presentation of CHF. Acute MI is generally associated with chest pain. However, patients with diabetes may present with so-called \"silent\" MI-- painless but evident on ECG.During an acute MI, patients frequently experience hypotension, complicating the use of evidenced-based acute treatments such as nitrates and beta-blockers, both of which lower blood pressure.

-   Anemia\
    Anemia, which can exacerbate ischemia, is unlikely to present acutely in the absence of other contributing disorders.

-   Arrhythmia\
    Arrhythmias cause heart failure by impeding the forward flow of blood through the heart. Atrial fibrillation and flutter commonly do this particularly when they are associated with rapid ventricular response. Without the atrial kick the ventricle does not fill as well, a problem which is exacerbated by the decreased filling time that occurs with tachycardia. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) may also cause this.

-   Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy\
    Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy is not related etiologically to CAD. There are four main types, including dilated, hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy has many causes, such as idiopathic, infectious (e.g. viral), toxic (e.g. alcoholic), or infiltrative (e.g. sarcoidosis). It should be considered a possible diagnosis with new onset CHF.

-   Pulmonary embolism\
    Pulmonary embolism, a common cause of acute dyspnea and chest pain, can precipitate right heart failure. It would likely occur in a patient with a history of malignancy, a hypercoagulable state, recent surgery, or prolonged immobility and would present with acute chest pain and dyspnea.

-   Hypothyroidism\
    Hypothyroidism can precipitate CHF and should be ruled out. However it is a relatively uncommon cause of new-onset CHF. With hypothyroidism the heart muscle is weakened, does not relax normally, and can result in diastolic dysfunction. There is a decrease in nitric oxide in the lining of the blood vessels resulting in stiffening. Increased LDL and myxedema (non-pitting edema) are seen, along with slowed heart rate.

-   Valvular disease\
    Valvular disease such as aortic stenosis is less common than the conditions above, although is becoming increasingly common in older patients. Hypertension may be present depending on the valvular disorder. Patients with aortic stenosis rarely present with severe hypertension, since the outflow obstruction impedes the ability of the heart to raise the systolic blood pressure.

Types of Heart Failure

-   Diastolic heart failure occurs when signs and symptoms of heart failure are present, but left ventricular function is preserved (ejection fraction \>45%). It is caused by impaired LV filling and abnormal LV relaxation and is most commonly related to uncontrolled hypertension. The incidence of diastolic heart failure increases with age and is more common in older women. Diastolic heart failure has recently been renamed 'heart failure with preserved EF' (HFpEF), though the two terms are synonymous.

    The left ventricle develops an abnormality of filling and becomes stiffer and noncompliant as the disease progresses. Then there is increased pulmonary vessel pressure during exercise, increased filling pressure and, as left atrial pressure and size increase, congestion. At this point, exercise intolerance increases and clinical signs of failure, particularly dyspnea on exertion (DOE), appear. It's like a backup in the pump with increasing pressure and leakage resulting. So pulmonary congestion, hepatic congestion and peripheral edema appear.

-   As it turns out, all patients with systolic dysfunction also have concomitant diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, a patient cannot have pure systolic heart failure. On the other hand, certain cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension may lead to diastolic dysfunction without concomitant systolic dysfunction. On average, 40% of patients with CHF have preserved systolic function. These patients have a better prognosis than those with systolic dysfunction.

Classification of Heart Failure

![Heart Failure Classification](figures/nyha-aha.jpeg){#tbl:heartfailureclassification width="80%"}

Management

-   Note: remove calcium channel blockers as these may worsen CHF

-   Thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos) are contraindicated in CHF

-   For patients with new onset CHF, send them to ED for evaluation; if cardiac ischemia is suspected, provide 325 mg tablet of aspirin to chew right away, and to place her on 2 liters/minute of oxygen by nasal cannula, then serial cardiac enzymes and cardiac monitoring

-   Refer for cardiac consult if due to ischemia; need either cardiac catheterization or a stress test to evaluate her for coronary artery disease. Her test results might indicate that she is a candidate for revascularization surgery; for example, if she had either triple vessel disease or left main artery disease. However, until her blood pressure and diabetes are controlled she is not a good surgical candidate.

-   Medications for CHF

    -   ACE inhibitors represent the mainstay of management of systolic heart failure. Multiple randomized trials have demonstrated reductions in mortality and hospitalizations among patients treated with these medications. They also have key roles in the management of both diabetes and coronary artery disease.

    -   ARBs have also been demonstrated to improve mortality in patients with systolic failure. Given that they are more expensive than ACE inhibitors, they are typically reserved for patients who can't tolerate ACEs due to side effects such as cough. An ACE inhibitor should not be combined with an ARB, due to evidence of harms when they are combined.

    -   An ARNI has recently been developed, and is a combination medication consisting of an ARB (valsartan) and sacubitril, a neprilysin inhibitor. Neprilysin plays a crucial role in the degradation of natriuretic peptides. An RCT comparing this ARNI to an ace-inhibitor alone found a reduction in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations in the ARNI group; side effects include hypotension and renal insufficiency. Thus, this ARNI may be an appropriate replacement for some patients, though more clinical experience will further define the impact of this medication.

    -   Certain Beta-blockers such as metoprolol succinate have a central role in the management of both diastolic and systolic heart failure. Specifically, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained-release metoprolol have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with NYHA Class II and III systolic heart failure (Grade C failure). Physicians need to have caution when starting beta-blocker therapy, since their negative inotropic and chronotropic effects can worsen failure initially. Generally, they should not be started in the setting of decompensated failure, and should be titrated up to maximal doses very slowly.

    -   Loop diuretics such as furosemide (Lasix) have a central role in the management of CHF to improve symptoms in patients with fluid retention. Fluid overload should be minimized so that other medications (such as ACE inhibitors and beta blockers) can work better. In patients with diastolic dysfunction (or Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction), excessive diuresis can worsen failure by decreasing left ventricular filling, so diuretics should be used with caution.

    -   Eplerenone (an aldosterone antagonist) was compared to placebo in a 2011 randomized, double-blind trial for NYHA Class II heart failure. Eplerenone reduced both the risk of death and the risk of hospitalization among patients with systolic heart failure whose ejection fraction was no more than 35% and who had mild symptoms (EMPHASIS-HF study). Other trials have demonstrated improvements in mortality for patients with NYHA Class III and IV heart failure who are treated with spironolactone, another aldosterone antagonist, but the efficacy of this particular potassium-sparing agent has not been demonstrated in NYHA Class II heart failure.

    -   Digoxin in randomized trials has demonstrated improved symptoms and reduced hospitalizations in patients with NYHA Class II, III, and IV systolic failure. Classes II and III fall under the umbrella of Grade C in the newer grading system. Physicians need to be cautious about digoxin toxicity, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency and in the elderly. Digoxin is not currently recommended for first-line therapy, but may be appropriate for certain patients.

-   The management of diastolic failure has been studied less than systolic failure. There are no randomized trials that demonstrate improvements in mortality for specific agents in this case. The general principles of treatment are to minimize fluid overload with diuretics, control the blood pressure, slow down the heart rate (particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation), and manage comorbid CHD. Many physicians start with either a **beta-blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (such as diltiazem)** in order to slow down the heart rate, increase the ventricular filling time, and decrease the blood pressure. Excessive diuresis and preload reduction can actually worsen diastolic failure. No role for digoxin or potassium-sparing diuretics in diastolic failure. ACEi may be used.

Aortic Conditions
-----------------

### Coarctation of the Aorta

Assuming sufficient severity of the coarctation, symptoms include chest pain, cold lower extremities, dizziness, syncope, exercise intolerance, failure to thrive, poor growth, headache, and dyspnea, among others. Distal to the coarctation, pulses will be diminished. Blood pressure will be lower in the lower extremities compared to the upper extremities. Murmurs may also be heart on auscultation. Coarctation of the aorta may also be associated with other congenital heart defects (bicuspid aortic valve in 50
