## GI devices

### The **Yankauer suction tip** 

(pronounced yang´kow-er)

An oral suctioning tool used in medical procedures. It is typically a firm plastic suction tip with a large opening surrounded by a bulbous head and is designed to allow effective suction without damaging surrounding tissue. This tool is used to suction oropharyngeal secretions in order to prevent aspiration. A Yankauer can also be used to clear operative sites during surgical procedures and its suctioned volume counted as blood loss during surgery

### **Sengstaken**–**Blakemore tube** 

This is a medical device inserted through the nose or mouth and **used** occasionally in the management of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to oesophageal varices (distended and fragile veins in the oesophageal wall, usually a result of cirrhosis).

- Find it in P1 in a fridge
- This is a large resort, to be used after scoping and medication fails to help

### Minnesota Tube

Minnesota tube (4 lumen) as opposed to the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube (3 lumen); the additional lumen enable aspiration of both gastric and oesophageal contents, not just gastric contents.

**USE**

- tamponade of gastro-oesophageal bleeding that is unresponsive to medical and endoscopic treatment (~90% effective)
