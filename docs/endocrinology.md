Acid-Base Disorders
-------------------

1.  Determine: Acidemia is \<7.35 and alkalemia is \>7.45

2.  What is the primary process

    -   For acidemia, \<22 mEq/L metabolic acidosis

    -   For acidemia, \>45 mmHg is respiratory acidosis

    -   For alkalemia, \>28 mEq/L is metabolic alkalosis

    -   For alkalemia, \<35 mmHg is respiratory alkalosis

3.  Degree of respiratory compensation

    -   For metabolic alkalosis $$\begin{aligned}
                    \ce{PaCO2} = 0.9 \times \text{bicarbonate} + 16 \pm 2
                \end{aligned}$$ Find the expected PaCO2 range.

    -   For metabolic acidosis - Winter's formula $$\begin{aligned}
                    \ce{PaCO2} = 1.5 \times \text{bicarbonate} + 8 \pm 2
                \end{aligned}$$

    -   Metabolic compensatory responses are delayed

Thyroid disorder
----------------

### Hyperthyroidism

Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include heat intolerance, frequent bowel movements, increased appetite, diaphoresis, nervousness, restlessness, weight loss, tremor, hair loss, and palpitations, among others. On examination, patients typically present with tachycardia, hypertension, hyperreflexia, and goiter. The patient will have elevated T3, T4, and serum glucose, and TSH may be depressed or elevated depending on the etiology.

Insulin Related Disorders
-------------------------

### Diabetes

#### Diagnosis

#### Health Impact

The majority of deaths from diabetes also results primarily from the increase in cardiovascular disease and chronic renal failure. Diabetics have twice the mortality of non-diabetics. The risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetics is so high that it is assumed that they have cardiovascular disease if they have diabetes.

Several guidelines recommend treatment to reduce HbA1c levels to less than 7%; however, clinical trials have not demonstrated reductions in cardiovascular events or mortality with intensive glucose control. Recently (March 2018), the American College of Physicians recommended that the treatment goal in patients with Diabetes should be an HbA1c between 7% and 8%; this is due to findings showing that treatment to targets of 7% or less compared to targets of 8% did not reduce deaths or macrovascular complications such as heart attack or stroke, but did result in substantial harms. Studies have also shown inconsistent improvement with intensive glucose control in microvascular complications, including nephropathy, but increased adverse effects, including weight gain, fluid retention, and symptomatic hypoglycemia.

### Insulinoma

A pancreatic tumor that secretes insulin and is associated with episodes of hypoglycemia and resultant cognitive dysfunction, palpitations, diaphoresis, and tremor.

### Acromegaly

-   Clinical feature

    -   Overgrowth of soft tissue

    -   Enlarged jaws, facial features, hands, and feet

-   Diagnosis

    -   Elevated insulin-like growth factor-1

Adrenal
-------

### Carcinoid Syndrome

-   Clinical features

    -   Presents with intermittent diarrhea and skin flushing

    -   a/w intestinal neuroendocrine tumors, pulmonary and/or tricuspid valve disease

### Pheochromocytoma

A tumor that arises from neuroendocrine cells in adrenal medulla. About 25% is inherited

-   VHL gene - von Hippel-Lindau

-   RET gene - multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2

-   NF1 gene - neurofibromatosis

Symptoms result from increased catecholamine secretion

-   Clinical features: episodic

    -   Headache

    -   Tachycardia / palpitations

    -   Sweating

    -   Hypertension

    -   May be accompanied by panic attacks

-   W/P - Rule of 10s

    -   10% bilateral

    -   10% extraadrenal (paragangliomas)

    -   10% malignant

    -   10% familial

-   Diagnosis

    -   Elevated urinary and plasma catecholamines and metanephrines

    -   Drug resistant HTN

    -   Hyperglycemia

Symptoms of pheochromocytoma include headache, diaphoresis, palpitations, tremor, nausea, weakness, anxiety, nervousness, irritability, and weight loss, among other symptoms. On physical examination, patients typically present with tachycardia and severely elevated blood pressure. For laboratory studies, the patient will have elevated urinary VMA, urinary HVA, urinary metanephrines, and serum glucose. Pheochromocytoma may be associated with various syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia and Von Hippel-Lindau disease.

Differentiate from neuroblastoma in children.

### Cushing Syndrome

-   Clinical manifestations

    -   Central obesity

    -   Skin atrophy and wide purplish striae

    -   Proximal muscle weakness

    -   HTN

    -   Glucose intolerance

    -   Skin hyperpigmentation (if due to ACTH excess)

    -   Depression and anxiety

-   Diagnosis

    -   24-hour urinary cortisol excretion

    -   Late night salivary cortisol assay

    -   Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test

#### Dexamethasone Suppression Test
Dexamethasone suppression test is used to evaluate hypercortisolism (i.e. Cushing Syndrome); suggestive manifestations include proximal muscle weaknss, facial plethora, and supravlavicular fat pads. Hypercortisolism is occasionally seen in MEN1, generally due to ACTH secreting pituitary tumors or adrenal tumors. Primary hyperparathyroidism is also seen in MEN1 and MEN2A.
