Endocrinology
=============

- All endocrine emergency, MUST check UPT if productive women. 
- Always find UNDERLYING causes
- Ventilators cannot easily help with hyperventilating patients - problem in RSI

## Pituitary Disorders



Thyroid disorder
----------------

### Hypothyroidism

![Screenshot 2020-06-19 at 09.35.58](figures/Screenshot%202020-06-19%20at%2009.35.58.png)

#### Myxedema Coma

- Misnomer - rarely oedema, rarely coma; better thought of as decompensated hypothyroidism
- Patients with hypothyroidism - under treated / undiagnosed, with no metabolic reserve
- Triggered by physiologic stressors (infections, surgery, trauma, burns, stroke, MI, cold environment etc)
- Typically elderly female

**Clinical Features**

- AMS
  - Hypoactive delirium
  - Not typically comatose per se
- Bradycardia
- Hypothermia
- Also might see
  - Features of a precipitating event e.g. stroke
  - Hypoglycemia
  - Hyponatremia
  - Hypoventilation
  - Reduced GI / bladder motility

**Physical Findings**

- Thyroidectomy scar, goiter
- Myxedema
  - Non-pitting oedema of hands/ face/ lower limbs
  - Voice hoarseness, macroglossia, scalloping of the tongue
- Hair loss
- Loss of outer third of eyebrow hair
- Cold intolerance
- Bradycardia, Bradypnea
- Muffled heart sounds
- Pleural effusions
- Abdo distension - secondary to ileus, ascites, ARU

**Investigation**

- TSH / T4 / Cortisol

- Renal panel - for hyponatremia

- Blood cultures, inflammatory markers

- CK for rhabdo

**Management**

- Aim for normoglycemia
- Correct hyponatremia - will also improve with thyroxine replacement
- Haemodynamic support
  - Fluids
  - Vasopressors - might be refractory to vasopressor treatment, without thyroid hormone replacement and steroids
  - Relief of cardiac tamponade if present - cautiously, these patients are coagulopathic (VWF disfunction)
    - Other invasive procedures need to be done very carefully as well
- Stress dose steroid: **Hydrocortisone 100 mg 8 hourly**
  - Hyperthyroidism can be associated with adrenal insufficiency (as in the converse, where thyroid storms can also be associated with adrenal insufficiency)
- IV levothyroxine replacement, consider T3 replacement(as T4 conversion to T3 can be impaired)
- REFER ENDOCRINE
- Investigate investigate investigate for trigger, consider empirical antibiotics for sepsis (commonest trigger).

### Hyperthyroidism

Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include heat intolerance, frequent bowel movements, increased appetite, diaphoresis, nervousness, restlessness, weight loss, tremor, hair loss, and palpitations, among others. On examination, patients typically present with tachycardia, hypertension, hyperreflexia, and goiter. The patient will have elevated T3, T4, and serum glucose, and TSH may be depressed or elevated depending on the etiology.

#### Thyroid Storm

![Screenshot 2020-06-19 at 10.45.58](figures/Screenshot%202020-06-19%20at%2010.45.58.png)

**Clinical Feature**

- Hyperthermia typically with diaphoresis (as opposed to dry in heatstroke)

![Screenshot 2020-06-19 at 10.46.46](figures/Screenshot%202020-06-19%20at%2010.46.46.png)

**Diagnosis**

- Primarily clinical diagnosis, BE SUSCIPIOUS

- Blood test does not differ very much from thyrotoxicosis
- May use Burch Criteria, but note that this is not very specific

**Management**

- Therapies for thyroid storm act by
  - Preventing release of T4 from the thyroid
  - Preventing peripheral conversion of T4 into F3
  - Preventing thyroid hormone synthesis
  - Preventing the sympathetic effects of severely elevated thyroid hormone levels
- As is the case for all endocrinological emergencies, hunt for an underlying cause. Typical triggers: sepsis, surgery, trauma, DKA, MI, CVA, drugs, pregnancy etc. And then treat it
- Corticosteroids
  - Block release of T4 from thyroid, inhibits peripheral conversion
  - Load IV hydrocortisone 200 mg stat, followed by 
- Iodide
  - Works by the wolff-chaikoff effect
    - Take more iodide thyroid make more hormone
    - Wolff-chaikoff effect prevents over production of thyroid hormone, paradoxical suppressive effect of thyroid in the presence of high levels of circulating iodide
  - To be given post-thioamide administration (give it an hour first)
  - Otherwise, the initial dosing might precipitate an increase in thyroid hormone synthesis before the WC effect takes hold
  - Lugol's solution, KI solution, 5 drops Q6 hourly
  - For allergies to iodine, use lithium instead

- If people can tolerate, go for propranolol. 
- Np, he is staying that the peripheral effect of non selective beta blocker is not ideal (why). Many patients cannot tolerate it. Therefore we would think about the selective beta blockers. However, if we think that the patients can tolerate the peripheral effects of non beta blocker, it is good to go for propranolol so that we can also take advantage of its T4 conversion blocking power.

### Diabetes

#### Diagnosis

#### Health Impact

The majority of deaths from diabetes also results primarily from the increase in cardiovascular disease and chronic renal failure. Diabetics have twice the mortality of non-diabetics. The risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetics is so high that it is assumed that they have cardiovascular disease if they have diabetes.

Several guidelines recommend treatment to reduce HbA1c levels to less than 7%; however, clinical trials have not demonstrated reductions in cardiovascular events or mortality with intensive glucose control. Recently (March 2018), the American College of Physicians recommended that the treatment goal in patients with Diabetes should be an HbA1c between 7% and 8%; this is due to findings showing that treatment to targets of 7% or less compared to targets of 8% did not reduce deaths or macrovascular complications such as heart attack or stroke, but did result in substantial harms. Studies have also shown inconsistent improvement with intensive glucose control in microvascular complications, including nephropathy, but increased adverse effects, including weight gain, fluid retention, and symptomatic hypoglycemia.

#### Diabetic Ketoacidosis

Diagnosis: HCO3 < 18, elevated serum or urine ketones, Glucose >14 with **acidosis**

- Acidosis NOT acidemia is required; may have normal pH
- Ketone we measure is beta-hydroxybutyric acid would be the most accurate test

**Management**

- Insulin therapy
  - **Hourly capillary glucose monitoring** and **potassium** levels
    - In insulin therapy, worry hypokalemia because insulin increases the permeability of cells to potassium (also Mg and Phosphate)
    - Start potassium replacement around 5 mmol/L; start at **20 mmol/hr KCl** replacement
      - IV insulin or calcium gluconate may be used if there is EKG changes for cardioprotective effect
      - Do not wait until hypokalemia
      - If patient is already hypokalemic, stop insulin, correct hypokalemia, then restart insulin
  - In severe acidosis, the requirement is higher than textbook recommendations due to increased insulin resistance
  - Consider IV insulin bolus 10 u if infusion set-up is taking too long
  - Consider IV insulin bolus in severe acidosis
  - IV insulin dosage **0.1 u/kg/hr**, can consider higher dosages in severe acidosis (severe acidosis results in insulin resistance, patients with chronic high dose insulin requirements might also require larger insulin infusion dosages of up to 0.3 unit/kg/hr)
  - Start patients on long acting basal insulin regimen as soon as possible (resume patient's old insulin home dosages if known) e.g. for insulin naive patients, Lantus starting is 0.25 unit/kg/day split into BD dose.
- Acidosis correction
  - Acidosis should rapidly correct with IV fluid replacement and insulin therapy
  - In severe acidosis <6.9, consider increasing insulin dosage
  - Avoid sodium carbonate which may worsen acidosis but improve pH
    - pH is the measure of extra cellular acid
    - Extracellular pH created
    - In patients with high circulating H+ form H2CO3 -> CO2, and H2O-
    - These patients have kussmaul breathing and have max respiratory drive, cannot blow off the CO2, eventually these then becomes H+ and Hco3-, producing more acid
    - Thus main stay therapy is fluid and insulin, if we HAVE to give, give little and slow.
  - Avoid intubation if you can
    - These are high risk intubations and is important to optimise patient's haemodynamic parameters as much as possible if intubation cannot be avoided
    - Obliterate the respiratory drive
      - Ventilator cannot match such respiratory drive to hyperventilate patients
      - CO2 will go up, worsen acidosis
    - Induce profound drop in pressure
    - If have to do it, say for a optimise the haemodynamics as much as possible before RSI
      - Make sure the patient has boluses of fluid
      - If HoTN, keep blood pressure up with vasopressor
  - End point of insulin therapy is the correction of HAGMA (the ketoacidosis)
    - Therefore, glucose levels might correct before the HAGMA does. So while insulin therapy is still on, start the patients on glucose infusions to avoid hypoglycaemia with insulin therapy. Consider starting IV dextrose infusions once capillary glucose readings are around 14 mmol/L
- Monitoring for response to therapy and complications
  - NAGMA
  - Fluid overload
    - Pediatrics DKA often half the fluid dose
  - Hypokalemia and hypoglycaemia - from IV insulin  
  - Cerebral oedema - patients with more hyperosmolar state, bring to a place with resus and more monitoring capability.
    - Young patient, paediatric patients at risk
    - Patients with significant hyperosmolarity, calculated serum ism >330
    - Can be seen in

  - Consider DVT prophylaxis

- Anuric - not as volume depleted, and not losing as much potassium; Go a lot more slower and more gently; Insulin is really excreted, go lower on the dose; Instead of 10 unit IV dose, we use 6 - 8 unit in renal patients - half life is prolonged and glucose and K can drop a lot faster.

#### Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State



**Management**

- Correct fluid deficit slowly over days aiming for euvolemia
  - Combination of osmotic diuresis
  - GI loss and reduced appetite
  - Use balanced crystal if large volume
- Insulin therapy

### Hypoglycemia

**Causes**

- Drugs
  - Insulin: accidental, iatrogenic, factitious/self harm
  - Increased insulin secretion: e.g. sulfonylureas
  - Other diabetic medications: SGLT2 inhibitors, metformin
  - Salicylate poisoning
  - NSAIDs
  - Non-selective beta-blockers
- Disease
  - Myxedema coma
  - Adrenal insufficiency
  - Hepatic failure
  - Renal failure (pre-disposition with insulin dose)
  - Increased endogenous insulin secretion (insulinoma)
- Depletion
  - Exercise
  - Starvation states
  - Alcohol binges

**Investigation**

- Serum insulin, c-peptide, cortisol

**Management**

- Try to replenish glucose: if obtunded IV dex, if conscious, give yummy sugary foods orally
  - Dessert is a great source of sugar replenishment
    - 1x premium, delicious velvety smooth ice cream from Creamier = 6L of 5% dextrose - patient satisfaction goes up, no risk of fluid overload
    - 1x snickers bar = 1.25 L of 5% dextrose
  - **IV dextrose** bolus: 50%, 20%, 10%, 5%
    - 40 ml bolus for D50 typically, and follow with large flush **20 mls**
    - If need to keep for a long time, try to use D5 over D10 because less irritating to the veins
      - Fast supplement over 2 hours (If D10 try to run ASAP)
      - For slow supplement give over 4 - 6 hours
- If persistent hypoglycaemia
  - Try to replenish again
  - Consider exogenous **corticosteroids** to increase insulin resistance and induce gluconeogenesis
  - Consider **octreotide** -  a somatostatin analogue for hypoglycaemia secondary to sulfonylurea toxicity (acts by inhibiting endogenous insulin release)
  - Look for other causes

### Insulinoma

A pancreatic tumor that secretes insulin and is associated with episodes of hypoglycemia and resultant cognitive dysfunction, palpitations, diaphoresis, and tremor.

### Acromegaly

-   Clinical feature

    -   Overgrowth of soft tissue

    -   Enlarged jaws, facial features, hands, and feet

-   Diagnosis

    -   Elevated insulin-like growth factor-1

Adrenal
-------

- Thyroid storm and some other endocrine conditions may cause adrenal problems
- CAH treatment is corticosteroids
- Neonatal shock is uncommon, CAH is one of the important reasons to get
  - Check out the metabolic derangements in CAH!
  - Never forget neonatal trauma

![Screenshot 2020-06-19 at 11.12.31](figures/Screenshot%202020-06-19%20at%2011.12.31.png)

- Number 1 cause of chronic adrenal insufficiency
  - Withdrawal from steroids
  - Addison's disease: Patch pigmentation of the oral mucosa, 
    - Patients are often diagnosed early in life, 

- DIVC patients esp meninggococcemia - adrenal hemorrhage - waterhouse-friedrichson syndrome
- Check point inhibitors have profound and bizarre complications
  - BE WORRIED! Immunotherapy comes in for vague symptoms e.g. SOB CP CF 
- IV hydrocortisone and IV dexamethasone take 1 - 2 hours to work; in the meantime support with fluids and vasopressors. 



### Carcinoid Syndrome

-   Clinical features

    -   Presents with intermittent diarrhea and skin flushing

    -   a/w intestinal neuroendocrine tumors, pulmonary and/or tricuspid valve disease

### Pheochromocytoma

A tumor that arises from neuroendocrine cells in adrenal medulla. About 25% is inherited

-   VHL gene - von Hippel-Lindau

-   RET gene - multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2

-   NF1 gene - neurofibromatosis

Symptoms result from increased catecholamine secretion

-   Clinical features: episodic

    -   Headache

    -   Tachycardia / palpitations

    -   Sweating

    -   Hypertension

    -   May be accompanied by panic attacks

-   W/P - Rule of 10s

    -   10% bilateral

    -   10% extraadrenal (paragangliomas)

    -   10% malignant

    -   10% familial

-   Diagnosis

    -   Elevated urinary and plasma catecholamines and metanephrines

    -   Drug resistant HTN

    -   Hyperglycemia

Symptoms of pheochromocytoma include headache, diaphoresis, palpitations, tremor, nausea, weakness, anxiety, nervousness, irritability, and weight loss, among other symptoms. On physical examination, patients typically present with tachycardia and severely elevated blood pressure. For laboratory studies, the patient will have elevated urinary VMA, urinary HVA, urinary metanephrines, and serum glucose. Pheochromocytoma may be associated with various syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia and Von Hippel-Lindau disease.

Differentiate from neuroblastoma in children.

### Cushing Syndrome

-   Clinical manifestations

    -   Central obesity

    -   Skin atrophy and wide purplish striae

    -   Proximal muscle weakness

    -   HTN

    -   Glucose intolerance

    -   Skin hyperpigmentation (if due to ACTH excess)

    -   Depression and anxiety

-   Diagnosis

    -   24-hour urinary cortisol excretion

    -   Late night salivary cortisol assay

    -   Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test

#### Dexamethasone Suppression Test
Dexamethasone suppression test is used to evaluate hypercortisolism (i.e. Cushing Syndrome); suggestive manifestations include proximal muscle weaknss, facial plethora, and supravlavicular fat pads. Hypercortisolism is occasionally seen in MEN1, generally due to ACTH secreting pituitary tumors or adrenal tumors. Primary hyperparathyroidism is also seen in MEN1 and MEN2A. 



### Addison's Disease



### Addisonian Crisis



## Metabolic Syndrome

### Dyslipidemia
