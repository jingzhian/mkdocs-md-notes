#### Severe Burn





## Pain



## Acute Desaturation

Or Airway obstruction and Breathlessness



## Acute Change in Mental State



## Acute Seizures



## Symptomatic Bradycardia



## Symptomatic Tachycardia



## Cardiac Arrest





## Hypotension or Shock

## Hypertensive Urgency and Emergency

-   Diagnosis

    -   Definition: HTN (urgency: SBP \>180, DBP:\>100) plus

        -   Heart is pumping at really high speed that they are losing troponin

        -   Headache that needs to be treated

-   Treatment: work up the patient first and depends on their baseline.
