## Pain Management in ED

- Appropriate for the intensity and type of pain
- Have a **prompt onset** of action
- Safe for that particular patient
  - Head injury patients should not be given sedative agent
  - HoTN patient should not receive opioid that might crash the BP
- **Effective**
- **Easy to administer** i.e. route of administration, available to us
  - Check what medication is where, in the wards or A&E, in the pharmacy (take 1 - 2 hours)



In general IV works in one circulation time, IM 5 - 10 min, PO 30 - 45

| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Renal colic           | IV                           | Need to work fast                                            |
| AMI                   | S/L GTN                      | GTN helps relieve pain by improving blood flow to the myocardium - the mechanism is right; Pain indicates cardiac ischemia; Morphine may increase morbidity in MI due to interaction with aspirin to reduce it's antiplatelet function; can give, not complete contraindication yet. |
| Menstrual Cramp       | PO Mefenamic Acid (Ponstan)  |                                                              |
| Drowsy trauma patient | IV paracetamol, IV ketorolac | Possibility of HoTH later, avoid opioids; drowsy inducing meds may affect assessment later; |
| Fracture              | Pentrox                      | Pentrox is really good for fractures; Need patient to be awake and ability to suck. It is inhalation. NSAID has theoretical bleeding risk. |
|                       |                              |                                                              |



- Renal colic IV is better 
- STEMI - S/L GTN
  - GTN helps relieve pain by improving blood flow to the myocardium
  - Pain indicates cardiac ischemia
  - Morphine may increase morbidity in MI due to interaction with aspirin to reduce it's antiplatelet function; can give, not complete contraindication yet. 
- Know about GTN patches - when would we use this?
- PO Mefenamic Acid (Ponstan) - NSAID
- IM Diclofenac
- IV tramadol
- IV morphine
- PO paracet
- IV ketorolac - only form of IV NSAID we have; in inpatient
- IM version of NSAID 15 - 20 mins; is next best choice; painful, larger dose more painful
