2. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR combined vaccine)
3. Rotavirus
4. Smallpox
5. Chickenpox
6. Yellow fever

### Considerations when using systemic immunosuppressants
1. Complications of chronic corticosteroid use:
    - Monitor for osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes and eye complications. 
    - There is also risk of reactivation of latent infections eg latent TB, hepatitis B/C.
    - Be aware of the risk of adrenal insufficiency during rapid tapering of steroids. 
      - Do blood pressure monitoring at home
      - Hypocount - hypoglycemia
2. Vaccinations:
    - Avoid live vaccines. In addition, vaccine efficacy may be limited in patients who are iatrogenically immunosuppressed.
3. Females of childbearing potential:
    - Avoid fetotoxic drugs such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab.

### Case

#### Surgical Pain Management

IASP definition \" An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage.\"

Why is it important to treat pain?

-   humane thing to treat pain

-   untreated pain can result in vital sign instability and precipitate pain

-   untreated pain can cause prolonged ileus post op

-   cannot mobilize early

-   cannot do chest therapy

Multimodal anelgesia - two or more drugs targetting different pathways

-   a combination of analgesics and techniques, each with a different mechanism of action within the central or peripheral nervous system). This approach may include opioid analgesics, nonopioid intravenous (IV) agents such as acetaminophen, ketamine, neuropathic pain medications (eg, gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine), nonselective anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or nefopam, as well as regional anesthesia, and other adjunct therapies (eg, massage, music, relaxation techniques). The specific approach can be individualized based on the source and severity of the patient's pain. Potential advantages of a multimodal approach include improved analgesia, reduced opioid dosing to achieve effective analgesia, and decreased risk of opioid-related side effects.â€©

-   Reduce opioid consumption

-   Make use of ea

How will you manage patient's severe pain?

-   already on paracetomal and morphine

-   fentanyl 25 mcg morphine - titrated, every 10 minutes small bolus

-   WHO pain ladder for cancer pain

    -   Mild pain: simple analgesics

    -   Moderate: codeine, tramadol, simple analgesics

    -   Severe: strong opioid with morphine and simple analgesics

    -   Other pain meds for neuropathic pain:

    This ladder was created by a nurse who started palliative care and wanted to promote the use of opioids, it is more important to be human. Widely used.

Different pathways

-   Intramuscular / subcutenaous

    -   Does not ned cannula

    -   Does not require intact GIT

    -   Rapid onset

    -   High bioavailability - 100

    -   Unpleasant esp for children and unpredictable absorption (variable time to peak effect)

-   Intravenous

    -   Does not require intact GIT, good absorption, rapid onset, high bioavailability

    -   Requires IV acesss and IV pump makes it more expensive

-   Transdermal

    -   Does not require intact GIT

    -   Slow onset-offset, dificult to titrate, heat increases absorption

-   Oral

    -   Inexpensive and non-invasive

    -   1st pass metabolism means require higher dose, slow onset, require intact GI system

What are the different ways that opioids can be administered intravenously

-   PCA - lock out time is about the onset of action of opioid (5-10 minutes); PCA can have a continuous mode programmed into it; 2 mg morphine at a time to titrate to the minimal analgesic concentration

-   Bolus

-   Continuous

Patient is drowsy, RR of 4, BP 170/90, HR 80; What are the differentials?

-   Patient: stroke

-   Surgical:

-   Anesthesia: medication chart and PCA reading - how much opioid is given

What to do? Always ABC in unstable patient!

-   Hypotventilation associate

-   0.04 mg IV naloxone then reassess in 2- 3 minutes; repeat and if inadequate response increase to 0.08 mg IV naloxone; keep reassessing and doubling the dose

-   Once adequate response achieved closely observe patient for minutes

-   If signs and symptoms not improving, consider, discussion goals of care, need for endotracheal intubation, and transfer to ICU / HighD

Common opioid related side effects

-   GI: constipation - give lactulose and sennoside 2 tabs ON, N/V - give anti-emetic drug ondansetron (People much prefer to have pain than N/V, need to treat intensely)

-   Pruiritus: antihistamine like loratidine, switch to other pain relief, morphine is most itchy, oxycodone and fentanyl is better.

-   Urorenal: Acute urinary retention - catherize

-   respiratory depression only in overdose

How to assess pain in dementia pain? Don't just assume that they cannot tell you about the pain

-   Pain score

-   Visual numeric scale

-   Vsiaul categorical scale

-   Visual analogue scale

-   Wong baker faces pain scale

-   FLACC Pain scale: face, legs, activity, cry, consolability

-   Pain assessment in advanced dementia score

Managing pain in patients with CKD

-   Avoid renal toxicity drugs: in patients with heart failure, chronic renal failure and or hypovolemia, renal blood flow is much more dependent on prostaglandin-induced vasodilation thant is would be in a healthy person. so NSAID induced reduction in prostaglandins can precipitate acute renal failure

-   Dose adjust dose dependent drugs: Morphine (M6G), Codeine, oxycodone (preferable to morphine), pethidine (norpethidine lowers seizure threshold)

-   Safe: Paracetamol, Tramadol (metabolites are inactive),

NSAID

-   MOA: inhibit COX which is part of the arachidonic acid pathway; resulting in decrease of

-   Adverse effects: GI, Renal failure precipitate, obstetric patients prolonged labor, premature closure of PDA, increase the risk of MI / CVA.

-   Routes of adminstration: Oral, parenterly (Ketofenac and parecoxib), IM (ketofenac), transfermal patch, cream,

-   How are COX-II inhibitors different from NSAIDS: COX I more involved with basic homeostatic function and COX II is thought to be induciable specifically at inflammatory locations. Note that this is not a black and white sicuation. There is a gradient of COX 2 selectivity,. Katorolac is very high COX1 selectivity, etorricoxib and celecoxib is very high COX2 selectivity.

Paracetomal - inhibit COX3 centrally not NSAID peripherally

For every side effect, consider

-   What is the side effect on each system

-   What is the patient's risk factor in that system

-   How to reduce risk\>

Pain score is high and localized over surgical site, no significant distress

-   Check the site first

-   Give morphine

-   Reassess in some time

#### CA patient with mets and abdominal pain and NBM

What do we find out about her pain history? Think immediate and long term

-   Abdominal pain and how severe

-   Mets symptomatic? Treated with opioid, need to consider withdrawal if kept NBM

Current painL palliative, paracetamol 1 g QDS, Celecoxib 200 mg OM, Targin 30 mg BD, and Oxycodone 5 mg Q2H/PRN for the last 3 months. What additional questions?

-   Has she been taking all the meds?

-   For PRN drugs, ask how often the patient has been needing it

-   How she has been tolerating the drugs

-   How effective is the drugs

What's the difference between Oxycodone, Oxycontin and Targin

-   Oxycodone - immediate release

-   Oxycontin - prolong release 12 hours

-   Targin - substance abuse form, lack Gi side effect like constipation,

Define dependence, tolerance, addiction, withdrawal and pseudoaddiction

-   Dependence - need for function and prevention of withdrawal

-   Tolerance - need more for same function

-   Addiction - psychological component like craving in addition to the physical dependence

-   Withdrawal - physical and psychological symptoms upon stopping a drug

-   Pseudoaddiction - patient think they are addicted but they are not

How to formulate a management plan for the patient's pain

-   IV formulation of drugs to replace current drugs to prevent withdrawal

-   Paracetamol and celecoxib can be given IV

-   Convert Targin and oxycodone to parenteral version using opioid conversion table to convert to oxycodone IV version or morphine - need to make a referral for this. The principles are

    -   Maintain regular provision of patient's pre-axisting opioid requirement

    -   Additional analgesia through appropirate short acting opioids

    -   Patients need higher dosese of opioids than opioid-naive patients

    -   Use multimodal analgesia

    -   Consider use of adjuvants such as local ansethetics and regional anesthetics

CTAP show lesion near rectum suggestive of a mets causing impending obstruction. Offered a palliative colostomy in view of that. For post op pain, discuss what other options apart fro opioids / NSAIDS . etc

-   Use regional analgesia - nerve block and central neuraxial blocks

-   Important for opioid tolerant patients

#### Lower back pain

21 year old NS enlistee went to visit ED for low back pain with left sided radiculopathy. This was on the background of lifting heavy jerry cans a week ago

-   Differentials: Mechanical, non-mechanical, visceral

    -   Mechanical - muscle strain, herniated disc, degenerated disc, spinal stenosis, fractures, pstepporosis

-   What other questions would you like to ask him?

    -   Yellow flag - secondary gains, poor relationship with co-workers, negative attitude,s fear avoidance behavior, expectation that pasive rather than active treatment, wil be benedifical, social problems

    -   Red flag - urinary retention, caudal equidal syndrome, thoracic pain, fever / unexplained weight loss, bladder or bowel dysfunction, history of malignancy, ill health or other medical illness, progressive neurological deficit, disturbed gait / saddle anesthesia, age \<20 yr or \> 55 year old

-   How would you examine him?

    -   Inspection

    -   Palpation

    -   Active and passive motion

    -   Sensory deficits, digital rectal exam

-   What investigations will you order?

    -   Lumbar X-ray anterior and lateral

    -   Train of four

    -   If red flag, refer to neuro or spine surgeon quickly

-   How to treat

    -   Bed rest is fine initially

    -   Pace himself, do not go back to normal activity

    -   Physical therapy for the patient

    -   NSAID - good for back pain and also radiculopathy (neuropathic)

    -   Adjunvent treatment - the original indication of the drug is not

Difference between somatic pain, neuropathic pain, and visceral pain

-   Somatic pain -

-   Neuropathic pain - SNRI, TCA, gabapentin

-   Visceral pain -


Antihistamine
---------------

Meclizine: treat motion sickness and vertigo., PO, effect begin in a few hours and last for up to a day.


Topicals

### Topical Corticosteroids

Key things to consider: diagnosis, vehicle, potency, frequency, side effect

#### Diagnosis

An accurate diagnosis is essential in selecting a topical corticosteroid. Topical corticosteroids are effective for conditions that are characterized by hyperproliferation, inflammation, and immunologic involvement. They can also provide symptomatic relief for burning and pruritic lesions.

#### Vesicle

There are several vehicles that can be used. The vehicle, or base, is the substance in which the active ingredient is dispersed. The base determines the rate at which the active ingredient is absorbed through the skin.

-   Creams: The cream base is a mixture of several different organic chemicals (oils) and water, and usually contains a preservative. It can be used in nearly any area and therefore most often prescribed. It is cosmetically most acceptable. It has a drying effect with continuous use, therefore best for acute exudative inflammation.

-   Ointments: The ointment base contains a limited number of organic compounds consisting primarily of grease such as petroleum jelly, with little or no water. Ointment is desirable for drier skin and has a greater penetration of medicine than a cream and therefore has enhanced potency.

-   Lotions and gels: Lotions contain alcohol, which has drying effect on an oozing lesion. Lotions are most useful in the scalp area because they penetrate easily and leave little residue. Gels have a jelly-like consistency and are beneficial for exudative inflammation, such as poison ivy.

#### Potency

The anti-inflammatory properties of topical corticosteroids result in part from their ability to induce vasoconstriction to the small blood vessels in the upper dermis. The potency of corticosteroids are tabulated in seven groups, with group I the strongest and group VII the weakest.

L1in\|L3in\|L2in Potency & Examples & Use to Treat\
Group I & Augmented betamethasone dipropionate 0.05%. Halobestasol propionate 0.05% & Psoriasis, lichen planus, severe hand eczema, and alopecia areata\
Group II & Desoximetasone, Fluocinonide 0.05% & Psoriasis, lichen planus, severe hand eczema, and alopecia areata.\
Group III & Betamethasone dipropionate 0.05%, Triamcinolone acetonide 0.5% (ointment or cream) & Atopic dermatitis, nummular eczema, stasis dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis\
Group IV & Floucinolone acetonide 0.025% (ointment), Triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% (ointment) & Atopic dermatitis, nummular eczema, stasis dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis.\
Group V & Floucinolone acetonide 0.025% (cream), Triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% (lotion) or Triamcinolone acetonide 0.025% (ointment) & Atopic dermatitis, nummular eczema, stasis dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis.\
Group VI & Alclometasone dipropionate 0.05%, Desonide 0.05% & Dermatitis in eyelids and diaper area, mild dermatitis on face, and mild intertrigo.\
Group VII & Hydrocortisone 1%, 2.5% & Dermatitis in eyelids and diaper area, mild dermatitis on face, and mild intertrigo.

#### Administration

Once or twice daily application is recommended for most preparations. More frequent administration does not provide better results.

#### Side effects

-   The most common side effect of topical corticosteroid is skin atrophy.

-   It also can cause hypopigmentation. This is more apparent with darker skin tones.

-   Topically applied high and ultra high potency corticosteroids can be absorbed well enough to cause systemic side effects. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal suppression, glaucoma, septic necrosis of the femoral head, hyperglycemia, hypertension and other systemic side effects have been reported.

### Systemic Steriods

Both steroids and CNS stimulants can cause an increase in blood pressure, especially when used in combination. Steroids increase blood pressure by mimicking endogenous cortisol and the sympathetic fight or flight response. Stimulants mimic norepinephrine, stimulating alpha and beta adrenergic receptors, causing an overall increase in blood pressure.

Contraceptive Medications
-------------------------

### Vaginal Ring

The vaginal ring is placed inside the vagina and left for three weeks. It is removed the fourth week to have a period.

### Progesterone-releasing intrauterine device (IUD)

is an effective option for reducing menstrual blood flow in those with menorrhagia secondary to fibroids. Another advantage is that it can be left in for five years (potentially longer but not yet widely accepted yet). There are potential complications, particularly during the procedure to place the device, but after appropriately discussing these with a patient it is a viable option. In studies, the progesterone-releasing IUD (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) has clearly demonstrated decreased menstrual flow in those with fibroids. In one smaller study, the device decreased overall uterine volume. However, it does not decrease the size of individual fibroids already in the uterus. Through decreasing uterine volume and endometrial atrophy, the progesterone-releasing IUD can also decrease dysmenorrhea. In people who hope to maintain fertility for the future yet control their symptoms now, this is one of the best options with fewest side effects. Irregular vaginal bleeding, especially initially, is a common side effect of the progesterone-releasing IUD. Other potential side effects are lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness. The risk of uterine perforation is more likely at the time of insertion. The risk of infection is within the first 20 days of insertion. Routine STI testing may be performed prior to or during insertion with immediate treatment if any infection is found. Good patient instructions to monitor for foul smelling discharge and signs of systemic infection or perforation are key.

The progesterone-only IUD can stay in place for three to seven years, depending on which device is used. There may be some irregular bleeding at the beginning for up to six months. Some women will stop bleeding altogether, and others continue having periods with less bleeding. The IUD is just taken out if the patient decides to try to get pregnant again. If, after five years, they decide they do not want to get pregnant, it can be replaced at the same visit for another five years.

It is ok to place the IUD while a patient is having period. It is infact easier because the cervix open up a little bit.

Contraindications: Infection or active gynecologic cancer, allergy to levonorgestrel (uncommon)

Cautions: History of headache or vascular disease, history of perforation with prior IUD placement, allergy to iodine or shellfish (often used to clean the cervix, other methods could be used).

Complications:

During the actual procedure, the patient can have pain or bleeding. There is also a risk of a uterine infection or perforation. Both of these are rare.

After the procedure is done, the patient may have some bleeding or cramping for a few days, but this usually responds to ibuprofen. There may be foul smelling vaginal discharge from an infection.

Once the IUD in place, there is a risk the uterus can expel it, or the patient may have pain with intercourse or experience irregular bleeding. Some partners can feel the string. After the patient's next period, she should come back to have the string checked and make sure it is still in place. It is a good idea for the patient to check for the IUD strings after every menses to ensure it stays inside the uterus but to use caution that it is not inadvertently removed. The strings can be trimmed at follow-up visits if needed.

The patient should return to the clinic for any fever associated with lower abdominal pain, with or without abnormal vaginal discharge. These signs would be concerning for uterine infection.

### Progestin Implants

These are put under the skin and last for three years. They can cause unpredictable spotting and can also be removed earlier if desired.

### Hormone Patch

The patch is left in place for one week, then the person uses a new patch weekly for three weeks. No patch is placed during the fourth week, during which time the person has a period. This option contains ethinyl estradiol in addition to a progestin.

### Combined hormonal contraceptive

Combined hormonal contraceptives would be an effective option if the patient has not experienced side effects from these in the past. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) have been proven effective when used for dysmenorrhea related to anovulation only without a structural problem, especially in a patient who needs birth control. In those with isolated dysmenorrhea, small trials have demonstrated benefit. However, a meta-analysis of these found insufficient evidence that oral combined hormonal pills are effective for dysmenorrhea alone. The confusion is that OCPs are often used in structural problems of the uterus that cause both menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea. In leiomyoma and adenomyosis, OCPs decrease blood loss and may decrease dysmenorrhea by thinning the endometrial lining. OCPs are commonly known to patients and providers making them often the initial step in management. In adolescents, they have the additional benefit of regulated menses. However, other options that are not oral, such as the vaginal ring ring and the hormonal patch, are worth considering. These may cause less nausea and vomiting as they bypass the gastrointestinal system altogether. All types of combined hormonal contraceptives have slightly increased risk of venous thromboembolism, highest in the first year of use. For this reason, these types are not recommended in smokers older than 35 years. Specific side effects with the patch may be site dermatitis in as many as 20% of users. The vaginal ring has risks of leukorrhea and vaginitis in approximately 5% of patients; the other types do not. None of these worsen cervical dysplasia or have been proven to increase the risk of breast cancer.

### Medroxyprogesterone

Injectable medroxyprogesterone is another potential treatment for leiomyomas and the symptoms associated with them. However, recent literature does demonstrate that there is bone density loss after several years of use. Other side effects may include weight gain, irregular menses for weeks to months, and potential mood changes. However, there is no risk of venous thromboembolism and this can be used in a smoker older than 35. This is a great choice for transgender men as it can help decrease periods without additional estrogen or a traumatizing procedure.

The shot is given every 12 weeks. If a patient on this decides to get pregnant, it may take a little longer to get pregnant after stopping the shots than if they used the IUD. It also has a higher rate of irregular bleeding at the beginning.

### Copper IUD

The copper IUD is another effective form of birth control. This device may stay inside the uterus for up to 10 years. For those who are not planning any children in the near future, this may be a viable option for birth control. An advantage of the copper IUD is that it has no hormones. However, in people using this, there is an increased risk of dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia just from the IUD. It is not a treatment for leiomyomas at all. In this case it could potentially make the symptoms worse.

Chronic Pain Medications
------------------------

### Opioids

The use of opioids for chronic pain is controversial due to uncertain benefits for long-term pain control and very serious side effects. The recent rises in opiate addition and overdose in the US call into question the liberal use of these medications for chronic pain. Conversely, strict avoidance of these medications likely will leave some patients with considerable pain and poor function, particularly those with contraindications to other regimens (eg. NSAIDS).

-   The most common side effect of long-acting opioids is constipation, though the most serious ones are addiction and overdose.

-   The initiation of opioids for chronic pain should only be done with carefully-selected patients who have failed other regimens, who do not have identifiable increased risk for opioid abuse or misuse, and who understand the risks of chronic opioids.

-   A structured process of prescribing is advised. This includes clarification of a Pain Management Agreement between the prescriber and patient; regular visits that include review of function and side effects, intermittent urine drug screening, and checking of the state Prescription Monitoring Program database.

#### Tramadol

Tramadol is a centrally-acting synthetic opioid analgesic that works by binding to mu-opioid receptors and weakly inhibiting norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake.

-   Side effects

    -   Serious: lowering the seizure threshold in patients with epilepsy, serotonin syndrome, respiratory depression, angioedema, bronchospasm and dependency.

    -   Common: constipation, nausea, dizziness, and pruritis

### Tricyclic Antidepressants

-   Can be helpful in patients with chronic pain, particularly neuropathic pain. Have added benefit of aiding with sleep interrupted by pain. Use limited by its side effects and contraindications below.

-   Tricyclic antidepressants have anticholinergic side effects, including dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision and paralytic ileus.

-   They also have many gastrointestinal side effects, are sedating, and can have neurologic side effects like ataxia, tremors, paresthesias, and mental clouding.

-   They are relatively contraindicated in patients with severe cardiovascular disease or conduction problems because they can contribute to tachycardia, arrhythmias, hyper- or hypotension, heart block, and myocardial infarctions.

### SSRIs and SNRIs

-   SSRIs and SNRIs have been demonstrated to be mildly to moderately effective in treating certain types of chronic pain, including fibromyalgia and diabetic neuropathy.

-   There are very high rates of depression among patients with chronic pain, and guidelines recommend assessing for and treating comorbid depression among patients with chronic pain.

### Anticonvulsants

Systematic reviews show that gabapentin and pregabalin are the only two anticonvulsants with demonstrated efficacy for neuropathic pain, and this is only for certain conditions (eg. diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia).

-   Some anticonvulsants require blood level monitoring and have severe side effects like megaloblastic anemia.

-   Carbamazepine (Tegretol) can interfere with other medications because it is a cytochrome P-450 inducer, including decreasing the effectiveness of hormonal contraception.

-   Several anticonvulsants are also known teratogens.

### Acupuncture

This has been used for many pain conditions. Some studies demonstrate effectiveness for dysmenorrhea without uterine pathology when compared to sham or placebo treatments. In further studies, acupuncture improves quality of life but may be associated with higher health costs for the patient. Other nonmedical and nonsurgical treatment considerations for dysmenorrhea include TENS unit (transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation), thiamine supplementation, and, possibly, vitamin E supplementation. These may be offered to patients who are opposed to other treatments or in combination with other medical treatments.

Anti-inflammatory Drugs
-----------------------

### Steroids

-   High dose glucocorticoid can cause glucocorticoid-induced psychosis, typically manifest in the first week of glucocorticoid treatment; it can also cause manic or depressive symptoms

### NSAIDS

-   Side Effects\
    Patients who use NSAIDs chronically - taking 5,000 or more pills in a lifetime - are at an increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease. Elderly patients are at an increased risk of developing gastric ulcers when using NSAIDs chronically. NSAIDs, aspirin, and acetaminophen can all cause hepatotoxicity, and contribute to coagulopathy.

    -   gastrointestinal upset

    -   decreasing the effectiveness of hypertension medications

    -   increasing the effect of sulfonylureas

Cardiovascular Medications
--------------------------

### Beta-blockers

  ------------ ------------------------------------------------------
  metoprolol   more on heart rate;
  atenolol     more on heart, affect renal;
  propanolol   great agent for anxiety and BP and some tachycardia;
  carbetalol   mix of both, heart rate and blood pressure;
  labetalol    heart rate and BP
  ------------ ------------------------------------------------------

Diabetes medications
--------------------

#### Thiazolidinedione

-   Pioglitazone: not recommended in pregnancy due to adverse effects in animal reproduction studies

#### Sulfonylureas

Older ones:

-   Chlorpropamide

-   Tolbutamide

Not recommended during pregnancy, cross placenta and can cause fetal hyperinsulinemia, and neonatal hypoglycemia.

Anti-coagulants
---------------

### Warfarin

Advantages of warfarin

-   Cheap

-   Antagonist available - vitamin K

Prothrombopenic drugs like warfarin are not suitable for initial therapy in thromboembolism because their onset of action is too slow. Their only role is in maintaining anticoagulant protection for prolonged periods.

Monitor warfarin dose by measuring the INR and titrate the warfarin dose every three to seven days to an INR of 2.0-3.0. The half-life of warfarin is around 40 hours, that means it will take five to seven days for the steady state to be stable. When making a dose adjustment for a outpatient on warfarin, one should wait at least this long before rechecking an INR, as checking sooner can lead to overreactions and great swings in a patient's INR.

The advantages of warfarin include its minimal cost and familiarity among medical providers. Its disadvantages include its highly variable dosing range, its requirement of frequent laboratory monitoring, and its high rate of interactions with other medications.

If the goal INR is substantially overshot, it increases the risk of bleeding complications significantly. In this case Warfarin should be held, and an oral dose of Vitamin K should be given to reduce INR if the INR is above 9. Otherwise, if the INR is between 4 - 9, just discontinue warfarin and check INR again in 24 hours.

### Heparin

LMWH has several advantages over unfractionated heparin:

-   Longer biologic half-life so it can be administered subcutaneously once or twice daily

-   Laboratory monitoring is not required

-   Thrombocytopenia is less likely although periodic monitoring of platelets may be needed

-   Dosing is fixed

-   Bleeding complications are less common

LMWH may be used in the outpatient setting; whereas unfractionated heparin requires hospitalization as it is administered intravenously with the dosage based on body weight and titrated based on the activated partial thromboplastin time.

One advantage to unfractionated heparin is that it can be immediately shut off and reversed in the case of bleeding due to its very short half-life. In a patient with a significant bleeding risk (e.g. recent admission for gastrointestinal bleeding), it is advisable to choose unfractionated heparin over low molecular weight heparin, which has a much longer half-life once injected.

### factor Xa inhibitor

This relatively new class of drugs has the advantage of not requiring weekly lab monitoring of INR and thus makes adherence an easier process.

-   Fondaparinux is the parental form of the drug and could be used instead of LMWH.

-   Rivaroxaban and apixaban are oral factor Xa inhibitors which may be used in place of warfarin.

Although these drugs have been found to be as effective as and generally safer (i.e. fewer bleeding complications) than warfarin and LMWH, the negatives of this class of medications includes high cost and difficulty in reversing the anticoagulation in the face of a bleed.

### Direct Thrombin Inhibitors

Dabigatran is the only direct thrombin inhibitor available on the US market currently. Like the factor Xa inhibitors, dabigatran may be taken orally and does not require laboratory monitoring. It also has been demonstrated in meta-analyses to lead to fewer bleeding complications compared to warfarin.

One potential advantage to dabigatran over the factor Xa inhibitors is that a reversal agent (idarucizumab) was recently approved by the FDA, which may be useful in the case of serious bleeding. Neither direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors may be used in pregnant patients (unlike heparin, they cross the blood-placenta barrier) or in patient with significant renal disease.

When using dabigatran, overlap with enoxaparin for 5 days.

-   Fluoxetine: Long half-life SSRI (i.e. 4 -6 days)

-   Escitalopram:

-   Citalopram: dose-related QT prolongation, avoid esp in patients with recent MI

General Counselling

-   Although some individuals respond after 2 weeks, most take 4 - 6 weeks to respond

-   Patients might experience early common side effects include headache, nausea, insomnia/somnolence, increased anxiety, and dizziness.

    -   Stimulating effects (new onset-anxiety, insomnia) would benefit from a temporary dose reduction

    -   Patients with anxiety disorders are especially sensitive to activating effects of antidepressants and should be started at lower doses than what is typically necessary to treat depression (e.g. half the normal starting dose) with gradual increase to a therapeutic level over several weeks

    -   If 18 - 24 y/o patients have increased risk of suicidality during the initial weeks of SSRI treatment

-   Prolonged use may lead to sexual dysfunction, and weight gain

-   Important to continue taking the drug daily, because missed doses or abrupt discontinuation may be associated with SSRI discontinuation syndrome e.g. anxiety, duysphoria, flu-like symptoms need to do a supervised taper process

-   Tranylcypromine

Usage

-   Not first line for MDD due to side effect burden (e.g. sedation, weight gain) and potential for drug and food interactions (serotonin syndrome, tyramine hypertensive crisis)

-   Watch for MOAI induced hypertensive crisis - in patients on MAOI after consumption of foods rich in the sympathomimetic substance tyramine e.g. aged cheeses, aged, smoked, pickled or cured meats/fish/poultry. - this is NOT serotonin syndrome, it does not have hyperreflexia and myoclonus.

#### Atypical Antidepressant

-   Trazodone

    -   Serotonin-modulating antidepressant

    -   Extremely sedating, used at a low dose for sleep induction

    -   Orthostatic effects are problematic in the elderly

-   Mirtazapine:

    -   Alpha-2 receptor antagonist

    -   MDD for its noradrenaergic and serotonergic effects
