| Asterixis | A **bilateral, nonrhythmic, alternate flexion and extension movement** at the wrist (flapping) that occurs when the wrist is extended with the arms outstretched. Although classically associated with **hepatic encephalopathy** (HE), asterixis can also be seen with **uremic encephalopathy** (due to acute or chronic renal failure) and **CO2 retention**. It likely develops due to interruption of the neural pathways that sustain muscle contraction. |
| Athetosis | A condition in which **abnormal muscle contraction** causes **involuntary writhing movements**. It affects some people with cerebral palsy, impairing speech and use of the hands. |
