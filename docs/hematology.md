Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies
=======================================

Some Definitions

-   Acute Leukemia: Blocked hematopoiesis with increased blasts and cytopenia in peripheral blood.

Myeloproliferative Disease
--------------------------

### Myelodysplastic Syndromes

A set of bone marrow disorders associated with diverse mutatins that leads to ineffective hematopoiesis affecting at least 2 cell lines, resulting in cytopenias and hypercellular bone marrow.

-   Progression is indolent but transformation to acute leukemia occurs in some cases

### Acute Myelogenous Leukemia

Neoplastic transformation of a bone marrow stem cell that is incapable of differentiating into mature leukocytes; so that a large number of blasts invade the bone marrow and peripheral blood.

-   Epidemiology: middle-aged, peaking 50y/o

-   Presentation: bone marrow failure - neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia

-   Diagnosis: Peripheral Blood Smear, CDC differential

    -   Auer Rods (Eosinophilic, needle like inclusions of myeloid cells) is pathognomonic! This is present in \>20% of marrow blasts.

    -   Leukocytosis may be mild or absent, giving rise to aleukemic leukemia; but most of the circulating leukocytes are blasts or immature myeloid forms

    -   Subdivided into 7 types based on degree of maturation of blasts, their morphology and coexisting cytogenetic abnormalities; each has different prognostic and therapeutic implications;

        -   M2 t(8;21)

        -   M3 t(15;17) - aka acute PML; PML gene ftion with retinoic acid receptor gene and the disease does not respond to retinoic acid transcription inhibition at physiological level

        -   M4 inv(16) -- cKIT mutation

-   Treatment and Prognosis: Poorer

    -   Lenalidomid to increase erythropoiesis by increasing colony forming activity

    -   5' deazacytidine (inhibitor of DNA methyltansferase)

    -   M3 can be treated with retinoic acid and As2O3 to enable differentiation into neutrophils which only live for 10 -- 12 hours and hence leukemia get cleared from body very fast!!

### Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia

A myeloproliferative disease in which neoplastic bone marrow precursors are still capable of differentiating along myeloid lines, so that most circulating leukemic cells appear as mature white blood cells.

-   Epidemiology: middle-aged

-   Presentation:

-   Diagnosis:

    -   Philadelphia chromosomes (balanced translocation between 9q and 22q) present in 95% of cases

    -   Significant leukocytosis (often $>500 000$/mm3, or 10 times of leukemoid reaction)

    -   Platelet count and erythrocyte count can be normal or even slightly elevated

Lymphoproliferative Diseases
----------------------------

### Leukemoid Reaction

An abnormal elevation of white cell count in response to infections, rarely $>50,000$/mm3.

-   Diagnosis: Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is useful in differentiating between leukemoid reaction and leukemia; the enzyme is elevated in leukemoid reaction but low in leukemia

### Mantle Cell Lymphoma

-   Diagnosis: CD5 zx, CD20, Cyclin D

### Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder Associated with EBV infection, test for EBV.

### B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

-   Epidemiology: children, peak 3-7 year old

-   Presentation: bone marrow failure

-   Diagnosis: Lymphocytic marker e.g. TdT

    -   CD 19 marker of early B cells ; CD 14 marker of immaturity

    -   25% BCR-ABL fusion mutation

-   Treatment

    -   If BCR-ABL mutation is present, use BCR-ABL inhibitor like in CML

-   Prognosis: Excellent

### T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia / Lymphoma

-   Epidemiology: adolescent male

-   Presentation: Thymic mass

-   Diagnosis: Mutated NOTCH-1, which matures T-cells

-   Prognosis: Excellent

Coagulopathies
--------------

### von Willebrand Disease

Common coagulopathy that is due to a quantitative or qualitative vVWF deficiency. VWF assist in platelet adhersion and aggregation and acts as a carrier protein for factor VIII. Factor VIII is more rapidly degraded when unbound, and VWF deficiency therefore lead to impairment of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. However patient can have a normal aPTT

-   Presentation

    -   Mucocutaneous bleeding (e.g. epistaxis, gingival bleeding, postpartum hemorrhage)

-   Diagnosis

    -   Normal aPTT despite problems with intrinsic pathway because

        -   Mild to moderate VWF deficiency may have adequate factor VIII levels to maintain aPTT within normal range

        -   VWF and factor VIII are acute-phase reactants, stress and inflammation can acutely raise levels

        -   VWF synthesis is increased by estrogen and thyroid hormones; pregnancy, oral contraceptives, and thyroid hormone replacement can raise VWF levels and normalize aPTT

    -   Normal PT platelet count

    -   Prolonged bleeding time

    -   VMF antigen, activity, and factor VIII levels are abnormal

-   Management

    -   Desmopressin (DDAVP) potentiates release of VWF from endothelial cells and can be used in management of acute bleeding or for prophylaxis

Other Disorders
---------------

### Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)

An autosomal dominant disorder involving alterations in enzymes involved in heme biosynthesis, is characterized by acute, intermittent neurovisceral attacks.

-   Clinical Feature

    -   Typically patient in 20s or 30s

    -   New onset of psychiatric and neurologic abnormalities - likely due to differences in expression of altered enzymes

    -   following a period of fasting - carbohydrate restriction induces enzyme synthesis

    -   or use of tobacco, alcohol, and certain medications e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin

    -   accompanied by unexplained, acute abdominal pain - neuropathic in nature therefore abdominal tenderness in response to palpation is frequently absent on PE

    -   May have vomiting, constipation, and tachycardia

    -   Symptoms can last for days to weeks and usually resolve between attacks

    -   and a family history of similar episodic symptoms

-   Laboratory

    -   Elevated urinary porphobilinogen levels during an attach are diagnostic

-   Treatment

    -   Hemin (Brand name: Panhematin) - Amelioration of recurrent attacks of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) temporarily related to the menstrual cycle in susceptible women and similar symptoms which occur in other patients with AIP, porphyria variegata and hereditary coproporphyria.
