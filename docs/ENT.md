General
-------

-   In childhood, because the immune system is still developing, they may have palpable lymph nodes.

-   ENT emergencies: epistaxis, aero-digestive foreign bodies, airway obstruction

Procedures required

-   Otoscope

-   Head and neck examination

-   Routine audiometric and vestibular tests

-   Voice and allergy testing

-   Hearing center - audiometric and vestibular assessments

-   Rehabilitation of hearing impaired children and cochlear implants

### Rinne and Webber Tests

L2in\|2in\|2in & Rinne & Webber\
Normal & AC \> BC in both ears & Midline\
Conductive hearing loss & BC \> AC in affect ear & Lateralizes to the affected ear\
Sensorineural hearing loss & AC \> BC in both ears & Lateralizes to the unaffected ear\
Mixed hearing loss & BC \> AC in affect ear & Lateralizes to the unaffected ear\

In conductive hearing loss, Webber test lateralizes to the affected ear because the conductive deficit masks the ambient noise in the room, allowing the sound to be better heard. In sensorneural hearing loss, Webber test lateralizes to the unaffected ear because the inner ear on the affected side is impaired and does not allow sound to be heard. Rinne because abnormal if there is a component of conductive problem in hearing lost only.

### Audiometry and Tympanometry

Pure Tone Audiometry

-   For identifying the hearing thresholds

-   Need a very quiet room

-   Audiometer can be paired with different transducers: Bone vibrator, ear phone

-   Other than the tones, we can also do PTA, speech, tinnitus match, loudness discomfort level, aided

-   International audiogram symbols are used to document audiometry findings

-   Get (100 Hz + 1kHz + 2kHz)/3 for quantifying abnormality

-   Cross hearing can happen, masking or noise presented to the no-test ear helps

Tympanometry

-   checks the status of the middle ear cavity, by putting a probe in the middle ear. The probe has three parts, one top generates tone, one generates pressure, one measures the reflected sound

-   Study the mobility of the ear drum

-   middle ear compliance: 0.3 - 2.5 cc is normal

    -   Type As - Increased compliance: very thin TM, ossicular discontinuity

    -   Type Ad - Decreased compliance: otosclerosis, thick scarring on TM

-   middle ear pressure: +/- 100 daPa

    -   C tyoe - pressure peak

    -   B type - perforated eardrum, decreased middle ear mobility

Speech Banana

-   Left beating nystagmus differentials

    -   Fast phase beats to normal peripherally i.e. peripheral right weakness

    -   Fast phase beats to problem centrally i.e. early stroke

-   Frenzel's goggles

-   Stopbang scoring for OSA

Presentations
-------------

### Epistaxsis

Primarily a pediatric conditions. Most of the bleeding is from the Little's area or Kisselbach's Plexus. This is the area of anastomosis of several arteries.

Reasons for epistaxis can be:

-   Spontaneous (90% - not serious) - typically due to crusts formation on the Little's area secondary to inhalation of dry air (e.g. in AC room)

-   Vascular lesions:

    -   haemangioma - excision under GA, rare

    -   angiofibroma

-   Blood dyscrasias

First aid: Pinch nose for about 10 minutes (or count slowly to 100). Most of the time this is enough and does not need to be cauterized. Chemical cautery using silver nitrate can also be used.

### Deafness / Hearing loss

#### Congenital Deafness

#### Acquired Deafness

### Balancing Problem

### Vertigo / Dizziness

Note that approach from ER, neuro, neuroopthal, ENT are different

-   ER

    -   vestiular vs non-vestibular

    -   non-vestibular implies medical and surgical conditions; remember to do DRE because patient might be bleeding and resulting in hypotension

-   Neurologist: after comfirming medical

    -   Vestibular cause - peripheral vs central

    -   Central vestibular cause - history, exam, oculomotor test, smooth pursuit,gze testing, nystagmus directional changing, up or downbeat, HINTs, VOR cancellation, gait, rombergs etc.

-   Neuroopthal

    -   With visual symptoms or without visual symptoms

-   Vestibular therapist

    -   function

    -   Unilateral vs bilateral

    -   Compensated or decompensated

Balance:

-   Physilogical: motion sickness (young female, mismatch of ocular vs vestibular, sit in front, mild sedative, height vertigo (ocular overload); the key is

-   Pathological

    -   Vertigo alone: vestibular neuronitis ddx anemia, hoTN, lupus and autoimmune condition, multiple sclerosis

    -   Vertigo with positional change: arnold chiari malgormation, BPPV (central vs peripheral - did the nystagmus fatigue - horizontal canal caplolithiasis),

    -   Vertigo with hearing loss and tinnitus: infection (Ramsay Hunt syndrome, influenza, mumps and measles, syphilis labyrinthitis), cholesteatoma with perilymph fistula, medical conditions e.g. lupus autoimmune conditions, syphilitic ladyrinthitis, vestibular schwannoma, meniere's disease (retrospective diagnosis, fluctuating)

    -   Vertigo with central symptoms and signs - LOC vs blackout, 3Ds dipoplia dysarthia, dysphasia, nystagmus ++, but minimal subjective symptoms e.g. vomiting, peripheral numbness or weakness, etc.

    -   Dysequilibrium of age

### Tinnitus

### Ear Pain

### Ear Discharge

### Facial Palsy

### Parotid Gland Swelling

-   Bilateral, non-tender - sialadenosis (alcohol, vit A def)

-   Bilateral, tender, after fever headache myalgia a few days prior - mumps

-   Bilateral, nontender, associated with dry mouth typically in woman - Sjogren syndrome

-   Unilateral, nonender - pleomorphic adenoma

-   Unilateral, tender, fluctuating, associated with eating - sialolithiasis

### Retrophargyngeal Abcess

Presents with neck pain, odynophagia, and fever. May be due to penetrating trauma to posterior pharynx. Examination findings may include nuchal rigidity and bulging of the pharyngeal wall. These can progress quickly with potentiall fatal complications.

Infection within the retropharyngeal space drains inferiorly to the superior mediastinum. Spread to the carotid sheath can cause thrombosis of the internal jugular vein and deficits in cranial nerves IX, X, XI, XII. Extension through the alar fascia into the danger space can rapidly transmit infection into the posterior mediastinum to the level of the diaphgram. Acute necrotizing mediastinitis is a life-threatening complication characterized by fever, chest pain, dyspnea, and odytnophagia, and reuqires urgent surgical intervention.

### Subdural Empyema

Extension of infection from paranasal sinuses through the underlying bone. Clinical findings include fever, headache, and mass effect signs (e.g. altered mental state).

### Cavernous sinus thrombosis

Most often due to contiguous spread of infection from the medial third of the face, sinuses, or teeth via the valveless facial venous system. Clinical findgins include headache, fever, cranial nerve deficits (e.g. diplopia), and proptosis.

### Spinal epidural abscess

These can be causedby hematogenous dissemination (e.g. intravenous drug abuse), continguous spread from vertebral osteomyelitis, or direct inoculation (e.g. epidural anesthesia). Symptoms include fever, focal back pain, and neurologic deficits.

### Thyroid Nodules

Thyroid nodules are common and may be diagnosed on physical examination or noted incidentally when imaging studies are obtained for other reasons. Once a thyroid nodule is found, cancer risk factors (e.g. family history, radiation exposure) should be assessed by history. Physical examination should evaluate the approximate size, mobility, and firmness of the thyroid nodule and wheather enlarged cervical lymph nodes are present. A serum TSH should be obtained.

If TSH is low, radionuclide scans may be done. Such nodules are unlikely to be malignant.

If serum TSH is normal, a thyroid ultrasounds is conducted to determine nodule sonographic features and size. Certain sonographic features (e.g. microcalcification, irregular margins, internal vascularity) carry a much higher risk of malignancy than others (e.g. cystic or spongiform lesions). Thyroid nodules $>1$cm with high-risk sonographic features should undergo fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Thyroid noduldes $>2$cm should all undergo FNA unless they are cystic, as they have a lor risk of malignancy.

Pregnant women undergo the same evaluation but should not receive radioactive iodine (for either diagnosis or treatment), because it can lead to congenital hypothyroidism, intellectual disability, and increased risk of malignancy in the fetus. If a thyroidectomy is needed, it can often be delayed until after delivery. However, should the workup reveal a more aggressive or rapidly growing thyroid cancer, the optimal timing of surgery would be during the second trimester.

Thyroglobulin is produced by both normal thyroid tissue and differentiated thyroid cancer cells. Therefore, it is a useful tumor marker to monitor for recurrence after the thyroid gland has been completely removed.

### Neck Masses

Submandibular

-   Actinomyces lymphadenitis: submandibular mass with a draining sinus tract, typically occurs after dental infections or trauma in immunosuppressed patients and the sinus tract drain sulfur granules.

Midline

-   Thyroglossal duct cyst: tract between foramen cecum and base of anterior neck, cystic and moves with swallowing or tongue protusion, often presents after URTI.

-   Dermoid cyst: cystic mass with trapped epithelial debris, occurs along embryologic fusion planes, no displacement with tongue protusion

Lateral

-   Branchial cleft cyst: anterior to the SCM, tract may extend to the tonsillar fossa (2nd branchial arch) or pyriform recess (3rd branchial arch), often detected when it becomes secondarilyu infected after URTI, leading to

-   Reactive adenopathy: firm and often tender and multiple nodules

-   Mycobacterium avium lymphadenitis: necrotic lymph node, violaceous discoloration of the skin, frequent fistula formation

-   Laryngocele is an outpouching of the laryngeal mucosa that can be congenital or acquired. If it protudes through the thyrohyoid membrane, it can present as a lateral neck mass. It characteristically enlarges with Valsalva maneuver due to inflation with air. Acquired laryngoceles are classically seen in glassblowers or trumpet players due to repeated, intense oropharyngeal pressure.

Posterior

-   Cystic hygroma: dilated lymphatic vessels, and presents as a lateral cystic neck mass . It occurs most commonly in the posterior triangle of the neck and is typically diagnosed at birth or on prenatal ultrasound.

### The Catarrhal Child

Typical presentation

-   Gets 6 - 8 URTIs a year

-   In a childcare setting, this increases 4x to 24 - 26 times

-   Paraents complain that the child is perpetually having flu

-   Child may be subjected to several rounds of antibiotics and other symptomatic treatment; especially if they doctor hop.

### Leukoplakia

Although leukoplakia (white mucosal lesion) is often a benign, asymptomatic condition, evolving oral leukoplakia that is nonhomogeneous and friable (e.g. tasting blood) is concerning for squamous cell carcinoma, especially in a patient who uses smokeless tobacco.

### Enlargement of the Parotid Glands

### Voice Disorder

Ear Conditions
--------------

### External Ear Cholesteroma

### Otitis Externa

### Otitis Media

Acute if duration of Several types of OM

-   Purulent OM

-   Serous OM

-   Mucus OM

May resolve.

-   Management

    -   \<6mth: should be treated with antibiotics

    -   After 12 weeks, it becomes chronic, should drain.

    -   6mth - 2yr: cautiously observed first - depending on the certainty of the diagnosis, social supports, and clinical picture

    -   If \>2: observation without prescribing antibiotics

#### Children

Recurrent AOM - typically viral, no antibiotics

-   Chemoprophylaxia

-   Vaccination

-   Chronic case, use cromet tube, for 9 months to 10 months, and will drop spontaneously when it's done it's job

#### Adult

Jaw grows forward as we grow up,

#### Secretory Otitis Media

### Ramsay Hunt syndrome

Aka herpes zoster oticus, occurs when a shingles outbreak affects the facial nerve near one of your ears. In addition to the painful shingles rash, Ramsay Hunt syndrome can cause facial paralysis and hearing loss in the affected ear.

### Otosclerosis

Otosclerosis results from an imbalance of bone resorption and deposition that leads to stiffening and ultimately fixation of the stepes, which dampens the transmission of sound energy from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance. It tends to occur in younger Caucasian patients and is more common in women. Otosclerosis may progress during pregnancy.

Presentation

-   Progressive conductive hearing loss

-   Paradoxical improvement in speed discrimination in noisy environment (feature of conductive hearing loss). This is called oaracusis of Willis, possibly because CHL dampens the competing background noise, thereby allowing speech to be heard more clearly.

-   reddish hue behind tympanic membrane; ear examination is generally unremarkable, although excessive bony resorption can expose underlying blood vessels, leading to a reddish hue sometimes seen behind the tympanic membrane.

Management

-   Hearing amplification using hearing aids

-   surgical reconstruction of the stapes.

### Acoustic Neuroma

### Meniere's Disease

Presentation

-   Episodic vertigo, hearing loss, and aural fullness

Management

-   Conservative e.g. salt restriction, diuretics, vasodilators, labyrinthine sedative e,.g. Stemetil, Stugerone; more than 2/3 patients symptoms resolve on it's own.

-   Patient education on vertigo

-   Surgery

    -   Destructive: vestibular nerve section, labyrinthectomy, gentamicin infusion of the middle ear

    -   Reconstructive surgery: steroid infusion of the middle ear, endolymphatic sac surgery

    -   Others: Meniert's pump

    -   Advances: vestibular implant

### Alport Syndrome

Lamellated basement membrane

Can cause hereditary SNHL due to damage of the basement membrane in the cochlea. Presents with recurrent hematuria in childhood.

### Cholesteatoma

Nose Conditions
---------------

### Allergic Rhinitis

#### Children

Complications / Presentation

-   Asthma

-   Ostitis media

-   Sinusitis

-   Sleep apnea

-   Failure to thrive

-   Chronic cough

If you treat AR well, the child may not progress to having asthma.

Physical exam

-   Lots of swollen tissue

-   Yellow secretion - not infection!

Management

-   Do a lot of counselling: Dust mite protectors

-   Above 6 year old, we do skin prick test, unless a patient has been taking antihistamine or immuno supressants recently.

-   Intranasal corticosteriods

    -   Mometasone: 2 years onwards

    -   Fluticasone: 4 years onwards

    -   Triamcinolone: 6 years onwards

    -   Budesonide: 6 years onwards

-   Antihistmine: desloratidine, claritin etc. if the child only has running nose.

Beware of glucocorticoid overloading in atopic children! the child may be receiving g steroid therapy for eczema, asthma, and rhinitis.

#### Adult

### Acute Sinusitis

Complication

-   Orbital cellulitis and subperiosteal abscess; if eye movement is restricted and visual acuity is dropping, then we have to drain the child

### Nasal Polyposis

Recurrent bacterial sinusitis may result in nasal polyposis. This may manifest with nasal congestio and thick rhinorrhea. Recurrent sinusitis is not typically assoiciated with NPC.

Oropharyngeal Conditions
------------------------

### Foreign Bodies

A unilateral foul smelling mucopurulent nasal discharge in a child is pathognomonic of FB. The FB may be introduced by the child him/herself or by a sibling. Adults may have foreign body impaction as well, just less common.

### OSA

#### Children

-   

#### Adult

### GERD/LPR

### Croup / Bacterial trachitis

Presentation

-   With stridor

-   Usually in 1 - 3 year old

-   caused by parainfluenza.

-   Usually admited to peds if there is secondary bacterial infection

Imaging

-   Steeple sign classical of croup on CXR

### Group A Strep pharyngitis

Usually presents with acute-onset sore throat, tonsillar exudates, cervical lymphadenopathy, and no cough (Centor criteria).

### Infectious Epiglottis

This is a rapidly progressive and life-threatening disorder. Hib and Strep pneumoniae are the most common causative agents. Further risk is increased if there is diabetes mellitus, obesity, and preceding upper respiratory infection (disruption of the respiratory epithelium creates a portal of entry for bacteria) increasing infection risk.

Presentation

-   Children: classically sudden onset of drooling, dysphagia, distress

-   Adult: suble onset of sore throat, fever, laryngotracheal tenderness to palpation; with worsening swelling, difficulty swallowing, pooled oral secretions, and respiratory compromise (tachypnea, stridor) can develop.

Diagnosis

-   

-   Lateral neck radiograph: enlarged epiglottis with the loss of vallecular air space, and / or distended hypopharynx.

-   Respiratory compromise is less common in adults but can progress quickly, therefore, patients with significant compromise (e.g. hypoxia resistant to noninvasive intervention) require airway establishment (intubation) prior to considering neck radiograph.

Management

-   In patient unable to maintain adequate oxygen saturations, bag-valve-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen (to keep oxygen saturation %) should be initiated. If BVM does not result in adequate oxygenation, endotracheal intubation using a video laryngoscope (to facilitate direct visualization of the epiglottis) should be attempted. Howeverm given the risk of rapid respiratory deterioration, failure of a single attempt at endotracheal intubation with a video laryngoscope should immediately prompt the establishment of a surgical cricothyrotomy by the most experienced provider available (preferably a otolaryngologist or general surgeon). Cricothyrotomy establishes an airway below the epiglottal swelling and potential obstruction.

-   Once the airway is stablized, antimicrobial therapy is needed to clear the infection.

    -   Untreated HIV with white plaques on the orophargynx - Candida

    -   Broad-spectrum antibacterial agents (e.g. vancomycin, ceftriaxone)

-   Steroid to reduce edema around epiglottis

### Aphthous Ulcers

-   Management\
    Topical glucocorticoids are sometimes used to treat aphthous ulcers, which tend to be multiple, painful, and short-lasting (\<2 weeks).

### Sialadenosis

Benign noninflammatory swelliung of the salivary glands, which can result from overaccumulation of secretory granules in acinar cells (possibly due to abnormal autonomic innervation) in patients with chronic alcohol use, bulimia, or malnutrition

-   Presentation

    -   Gradual enlargement of the glands that does not fluctuate and is no associated with eating.

-   Management

    -   Investigate underlying disease e.g. alcoholism, vitamin A deficiency

### Ludwig's Angina

Rapidly progressive bilateral cellulitis of the submandibular and sublingual spaces, most often arising form an infected mandibular molar. Clinical finding include fever, dysphagia, odynophagia, and drooling.

### Parotitis

This can be due to mumps and can present with parotid swelling. However, it is typically painful and presents a few days after the onset of systemic symptoms (e.g. fever, headache, myalgias).

### Adenotonsillar Hypertrophy

Can cause OSA or recurrent tonsillitis.

### Peritonsillar abscess

This is a complication of tonsilitis. The condition can be fatal secondary to either aiway obstruction or spread of the infection into the paraphargyngeal space, which may lead to involvement of the carotid sheath.

Presentation

-   Muffled or hot potato voice

-   Uvula deviation.

-   Typically have prominent unilateral lymphadenopathy

Management

-   Aspiration of the peritonsillar abscess

-   Initiate intravenous antibiotics

-   Surgical intervention if the purulent material cannot be removed with aspiration alone.

### Surgical Neck Hematoma

Patient with enlarging fluid collection (ballotable neck swelling) after thyroidectomy likely has an expanding neck hematoma, or vascular compression causing venous congestion leading to laryngeal edema. Stridor, dysphagia, voice changes, with tripor positioning are all signs of increasing upper airway obstruction; however, patient can initially have few or no symptoms (e.g. only mild neck tightness). Patient can often maintain their peripheral blood oxygenation concentration until rapidly (\<1 min) decompensation.

Management

-   Immediately evacuate the hematoma (including at the bedside if necessary) by re-opening the incision and removing blood collection

-   The wound should then be explored in the operating room to control the source of bleeding, and the the patient's airway should be evaluated to assess for laryngeal edema and need for protective endotracheal intubation (until the edema subsides).

### Rhinoplasty complications

Complications are common following rhinoplasty, 1 in 4 may need revision. Common complications include patient dissatisfaction, nasal obstruction, and epistaxis. Those that involve the nasal septum are less common but more serious. The septum is made up of cartilage and has poor blood supply contrasting sharply with the rich anastomosing blood supply of the nasal sidewall. The underlying cartige relies completely on overlying mucosa for nourishment by diffusion. Because of the poor regenerating capacity of the septal cartilage, trauma, or surgery on the septum may result in septal perforation. The tyupical post-op presentation is a whistling noise heard during respiration. Following nasal surgery, septal perforation is typically the result of a septal hematoma though a septal abscess may also be the cause. Additional conditions that can cause septal perforation are self-inflicted trauma (nose picking), syphilis, tuberculosis, intranasal cocaine use, sarcoidosis, and granulomatosis with polyangitis (Wegner's).

### Nasal Furunculosis

Nasal furunculosis is a localized infection of the hair-bearing nasal vestibule. It is usually caused by the bacteria S aureus. It can occur as a primary infection or secondary to chronic rhinorrhea, upper respiratory infections, and nose picking. It is potentially life threatening as it can spread to the cavernous sinus. Patients complain of pain, tenderness and erythema in the nasal vestibule.

ENT Cancers
-----------

Most cancers of the head and neck arise from squamous epithelial cells that undergo stepwise, premalignant changes (i.e. hyperplasia to dysplasia to carcinoma). Lesions may initially manifest in the oral cavity as hyperplastic or dysplastic white (Leukoplakia) or red (erythroplakia) patches (which is likely what as noted on the patient's initial biopsy). Because these lesions are at right of malignant transformation, patients require counseling regarding risk reduction (e.g. tobacco chewing cessation), regular examination of the oral cavity, and rebiopsy if changes (e.g. thickness, firmness) are seen. If bioosy results are cancerous, regional metastatic spread to the cervical lymph nodes is highly likely; therefore, a CT scan of the neck with contrast should also be obtained, both to evaluate the extent of invasion and characterize the metastatic nodal spread.

### Vestibular Schwannoma

NF1 - peripheral neurofibromatosis NF2 - NF3 -

### Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma

NPC is associated with the reaction of EBV. Tumors typically express EBV DNA and EBV assays are often used to monitor treatment response and disease replase. NPC is endemic to Southern China and parts of Africa and Middle East. Risk is thought to be higher in these locations due to diet (salt-cured food, early exposure to salted fish) and genetic predispositions.

NPC tumors obstruct the nasophargynx and invade adjacent tissues, often resulting in nasal congestion with epistaxis, headache, cranial nerve palsies (e.g. facial numbness), and/or serous otitis media (eustachian tube obstruction). Early metastatic sprea to the cervical lymph notes may cause a nontender neck mass.
