Breast Lump
-----------

Physiologic:

Pregnancy Excessive breast stimulation Pathologic:

Prolactinoma Breast cancer \> Intraductal papilloma \> Mammary duct ectasia \> Paget disease of the breast \> Ductal carcinoma in situ Hormone imbalance Injury or trauma to breast Breast abscess Use of medications (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics, some antihypertensives and opiates) A comprehensive history and breast exam are necessary to evaluate the discharge.

For example, it is important to know if the discharge appears milky, purulent or bloody. Palpate nipples and check for any discharge. If a discharge is present, the patient needs further evaluation by imaging studies:

Mammogram Ultrasound Ductogram and/or Biopsy Consider hormonal testing to exclude endocrinological reasons. If discharge is milky, check the prolactin level.

Review and discontinue any medications that may be the cause.

Three Cs of Addiction

1.  Compulsion to use

2.  Lack of control

3.  Continued use despite adverse consequences

The five As of counseling for behavior change

1.  Ask or Address the behavior needing change

2.  Assess for interest in behavior change (note emotional impacts)

3.  Advise on methods to change behavior

4.  Assist with motivation to change behavior

5.  Arrange to follow-up

Stages of Behavior Change

1.  Pre-contemplative: not aware of need to change or not intereste in changing behavior

2.  Contemplative: currently interested in changing behavior

3.  Active: currentluy making a behavior change

4.  Relapse: Attempted behavior change but no longer making the change.

Smoking

-   Oral medications, such as bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban, Budeprion) or varenicline (Chantix), have moderate effects in helping smokers quit. Compared to placebo, smokers using oral medications have only 1.5 to 3 times higher quit rate at 12 months. Many physicians prefer prescribing bupropion to help smokers quit.Vareniciline is often reserved for those that have failed buproprion or if a patient specifically requests it. (What side effects?)

-   The annual quit rate for smokers without any medical interventions is about 2% to 3% per year.

-   Most smokers quit multiple times before being truly successful. It is helpful to view tobacco abuse as a chronic disease and continue to work with smokers who relapse.

-   Interventions that improve quit rates:

    -   Quit rates are highest when patients are engaged in a group setting.

    -   Oral medications are somewhat effective at helping people stop smoking, with quit rates at 12 months 1.5 to 3 times the placebo quit rate.

    -   When combined with medication, a series of one-on-one counseling sessions (as in a physician's office) enhances quit rates.

    -   Providing practical problem-solving skills, assistance with social supports, and use of relaxation/breathing techniques can increase quit rates.

    -   Financial or material incentives such as those provided in the workplaces, clinics and hospitals appear to increase cessation rates while in place.

-   Ideally

    -   Set a quit date

    -   Give instructions for taking bupropion

        -   Start one week before the quit date with one pill a day for the first three days, then increase to one pill twice a day, morning and evening.

        -   After another four days, stop smoking and continue on the pills twice a day.

        -   Add nicotine gum for bad cravings, if needed.

        -   After about two months on the pills, gradually stop.

    -   Provide other smoking cessation resources

Alcohol use

-   Up to 1 a day for women, up to 2 a day for men

-   Effect of moderate alcohol intake:

    -   small increase in HDL cholesterol (but exercise is an alternative, and niacin can be used to increase HDL to a greater degree)

    -   Alcohol or some substances such as resveratrol found in alcoholic beverages may prevent platelets in the blood from sticking together. That may reduce clot formation and reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke. (Aspirin may help reduce blood clotting in a similar way.)

    -   American Heart Association does not recommend drinking wine or any other form of alcohol to gain these potential benefits.

-   Effects of red wine: no conclusive evidence

-   Note effect on chronic disease - reduce effectiveness of medications

-   It is not always possible to identify those who will develop alcoholism, therefore screening all adult primary care patients to identify at-risk people and counseling is recommended as a preventive strategy. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is the most widely validated screening tool. It consists of 10 items and takes two to three minutes to complete, and longer to score. AUDIT-C is a brief version of the AUDIT comprising three questions scaled 0 to 12:

    -   \"How often do you have a drink containing alcohol?\"

    -   \"How many standard drinks containing alcohol do you have in a typical day?\"

    -   \"How often do you have six or more drinks on one occasion?\"

    A score of 4 in men and 3 in women is considered positive.

    An even briefer screening test, the Single-Item Alcohol Screening Questionnaire (SASQ), has been shown to be highly effective in primary care. \"How many times in the past year have you had X drinks in a day (X = 4 for women, 5 for men). Any answer above zero is considered a positive screen.

Food

-   How to obtain a more accurate diet history

    -   Usual diet history:

        -   Number of meals and snacks eaten in a 24-hour period

        -   Dining out habits

        -   Frequency of consumption of fruits, vegetables, meats, poultry, fish, dairy products, and desserts

        -   Meals missed (as important as those eaten in excess)

        Ask the patient to describe a typical day's diet. In addition, ask how often and under what circumstances the patient varies from this typical intake. This method is often combined with a 24-hour dietary recall.

    -   24-hour Dietary Recalls: Ask about each meal separately. Be sure to include snacks and beverages as well as portion sizes.

    -   Daily Dietary Intake Record (or Food Diaries)

        Ask the patient to bring in a complete record of everything consumed over a three- to four-day period. Have the patient include Saturday and Sunday, since many people eat differently on the weekend.

    -   Food Frequency Questionnaire

        Rapid Eating and Activity assessment for Patients (REAP) is a brief validated questionnaire that assesses diet related to the Food Guide Pyramid and the 2000 U.S. Dietary Guidelines. REAP includes questions to assess intake of whole grains; calcium-rich foods; fruits and vegetables; fat; saturated fat and cholesterol; sugary beverages and foods; sodium; alcoholic beverages; and physical activity. REAP also includes questions regarding whether the patient shops and prepares his/her own food; ever has trouble being able to shop or cook; follows a special diet; eats or limits certain foods for health or other reasons; and how willing the patient is to make changes to eat healthier. Patients can either fill out the instrument in the waiting room or have it sent home to complete before their appointment. The REAP Physician Key includes sections on patients at risk, further evaluation and treatment as well as counseling points/further information for each major dietary area.

Obesity

-   BMI is used clinically because actual measurement of percent body fat is difficult.

-   Increases risk for

    -   metabolic syndrome, characterized by abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance with or without impaired glucose tolerance.

    -   cardiovascular disease

-   Body fat distribution may provide additional risk stratification for coronary artery disease beyond BMI. Waist circumference and waist-hip ratio, as indicators of abdominal adiposity, are independent risk factors for coronary artery disease. Consider measuring these in overweight patients to further determine risk and need for weight loss.

-   Weight Loss Counseling

    -   Target a realistic weight goal.

    -   Reduce calories consumed and increase calories burned.

    -   Eliminate soft drinks; drink water instead.

    -   Eat five servings of fruits and vegetables. Meet with a dietitian.

Factors associated with decreased breast cancer risk include pregnancy at an early age, late menarche, early menopause, high parity and medications such as selective estrogen receptor modulators along with NSAIDs and aspirin. Risk factors for breast cancer include family history of breast cancer in a first degree relative (mother or sister), prolonged estrogen exposure (menarche before age 12, menopause after 55, advanced age at pregnancy, obesity after menopause), female sex, genetic predisposition (BRCA 1 or 2 mutation), advanced age (breast cancer risk increases with age), increased breast density and exposures (diethylstilbestrol, hormone or radiation therapy, smoking).

physical changes associated with dyslipidemia

-   Corneal arcus

-   Xanthelasma

-   Acanthosis nigricans

physical changes associated with atherosclerosis

-   decreased peripheral pulses

-   carotid bruit

adult vaccines

-   Influenza is recommended annually.

-   Substituting a one-time dose of Tdap for Td booster (tetanus and diphtheria) for ages 11 to 64 to provide additional pertussis protection, then boost with Td every 10 years.

-   Adults who smoke should receive a pneumococcal 23-valant polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23).

-   The CDC now recommends the recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) be given to every adult at age 50. This is a two-vaccine series given two to six months apart. Adults over 60 who previously received the live zoster vaccine (Zostavax) should be re-vaccinated with the recombinant vaccine.

Note: Live vaccines, like Zostavax (also MMR, OPV, and Varicella), should not be administered to immunocompromised patients, their close contacts, or to pregnant women.

USPSTF Grading System The USPSTF grades each recommendation according to one of five classifications:

-   A: The USPSTF recommends this service. There is high certainty that the service improves health outcomes; net benefit is substantial.

-   B: The USPSTF recommends this service. There is high certainty that the service improves health outcomes; net benefit is fair or fair certainty that the net benefit is moderate - substantial.

-   C: The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small.

-   D: The USPSTF recommends against providing this service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service does not have any net benefits, or harms outweigh benefits.

-   I: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the service.

prostate cancer screening with PSA

-   The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) changed its recommendation for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing from a D (recommending against it) to a C (selective recommendation) for men ages 55 to 69. They found that there is a slight reduction in death from prostate cancer among men who have PSA testing. The number needed to screen is 781 men to prevent one death from prostate cancer. There are also significant rates of complications from both PSA screening and treatment for prostate cancer as well as evidence of significant rates of overdiagnosis. Thus they concluded that the decision to screen should be an individualized one between a doctor and an individual patient.

The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years using:

-   fecal occult blood testing

-   sigmoidoscopy

-   colonoscopy

-   Fecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT Test)

-   Fecal DNA Testing

-   CT Colography

The ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines recommend reassessing patients' ASCVD risk (including HDL and total cholesterol) every four to six years. Given that they recommend treating with statins all patients over 21 with an LDL-c \> 190 mg/dL, it is reasonable to check fasting lipids in all adults over 21 every four to six years. Ideally, these are drawn in the fasting state at least eight hours after the last food intake. Non-fasting triglycerides may be significantly higher than fasting, but the total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C generally do not vary that much. LDL cholesterol can be determined via calculation based on other components of the lipid panel, or it can be directly measured. A \"measured\" LDL is often done when the patient's triglycerides are very high, invalidating LDL calculations.

How to read ECG

1.  Examine rate, PR interval, QRS, duration, and QT interval.

2.  Look for abnormalities in P waves.

3.  Assess axis, R wave progression, presence of Q waves, and level of voltage.

4.  Look for ST depression or elevation and inverted T waves.
