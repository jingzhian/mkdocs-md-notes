### Defense Mechanisms

#### Immature

L1 in L5 in Isolation & Removing feelings about an event\
Rationalization & Generate an explanation for an action performed for a different reason\
Distortion & Altering the perception of reality to make it more acceptable\
Fantasy & Substituting with imaginary scenarios\
Denial & Behaving as if the reality does not exist\
Repression & Unconscious withholding of psychological material from the conscious mind\
Dissociation & To disrupt memory, identity and consciousness to cope with an event\
Projection & Transplanting one's unacceptable impulse or affect onto another person's situation\
Displacement & Transfer the emotion about a situation / someone to a less threatening third party who is not involved\
Reaction formation & to redirect unacceptable impulses to its opposite; act opposite to what one think / feel\
Acting out & Expressing unacceptable thoughts or impulses through action\
Regression & Reverting back to a less mature form of coping with difficulty\
Identification & Model after someone who seems to be more powerful (can be good or bad)\
Splitting & Hold the unconscious belief that people are wholly good or wholly bad; characteristically borderline

#### Mature

  --------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Suppression           Intentional withholding of distressing unconscious material
  Intellectualization   Use intellect to avoid uncomfortable feelings
  Sublimation           Channel impulses to socially acceptable behaviors
  Humor                 Conscious and unconscious way of making light a difficult situation
  Altruism              Removing sense of guilty by giving to others without solicitation
  --------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Psychotherapy

  --------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Confrontation   to point out discrepancy in argument
  Facilitation    ask questions to move discussion along
  Empathy         try to put ourselves in the shoes of the patient and imagine the experience
  Support         express concern independent of understanding
  Reflection      to repeat what the patient is saying, perhaps by summarizing

  : General techniques that can be used during psychotherapy

#### Supportive Psychotherapy

-   Broadly applicable approach

-   Provide encouragement with the aim to reduce stress, improve coping skills / adaptive defenses, and maintain hope

Application: targets lower functioning patients, patients in crisis, psychotic patients

#### Motivational interviewing

targets lower functioning patients or patients in crisis

-   Enhances intrinsic motivation to change

-   Non judgemental; acknowledges ambivalence and resistance

Application: substance use disorders, medication adherence issues

#### Psychodynamic psychotherapy

-   Targets higher functioning patients

-   Trace problems back to their origins in childhood and unconscious conflict

-   May provide patients with insight and break down maladaptive defenses

#### Cognitive-behavioral therapy

Based on exposure and response prevention (ERP), challenges maladaptive cognition.

-   Use repeated exposure to thoughts, images, and situations that provoke obsessional fears followed by prevention of the accompanying compulsion

-   Initially anxiety increases, but with prolonged and repetitive exposure, habituation occurs and anxiety subsides.

Applications

-   Negative thought disorder

-   Depression

-   OCD

-   Eating disorder

-   Generalized anxiety disorder

-   Panic disorder

-   PTSD

#### Dialectical Behavioral Therapy

-   This integrates standard CBT techniques with principles of mindfulness, distress tolerance, and emotion regulation.

-   Aim to decrease self harm and builts skills

Application: borderline personality disorder

#### Interpersonal psychotherapy

-   links symptoms to current relationship conflicts and interpersonal skill deficits

Application: Depression

#### Biofeedback

-   Improves control over physiological reaction to emoitional stressors

Application: Patients with prominent physical symptoms e.g. muscle tension, anxiety, pain disorders

#### Family therapy

-   Resolve family tension

-   For schizophrenia patients - useful if patients live with family and have recent psychotic relapse

    -   Psychoeducation

    -   Symptoms, course, and treatment

    -   Importance of adherence to medication

    -   Develop realistic expectations for improvement

    -   Recognize early signs of relapse e.g. negative symptoms are not laziness

### ECT

3 times a week for a course of 6 - 12 treatments.

-   Indication for use in Depression

    -   Treatment resistance

    -   Psychotic features

    -   Emergency conditions

        -   Pregnancy

        -   Refusal to eat or drink

        -   Imminent risk for suicide

-   Risk

    -   No absolute contraindications

    -   Increased risk

        -   Severe cardiovascular disease, recent MI

        -   Space-occupying brain lesion

        -   Recent stroke, unstable aneurysm

### Miscellaneous

-   Difference between classical conditioning and operant conditioning is that operant conditioning generates a behavior via rewards but in classical conditioning a reflex response is elicited.

-   The single strongest predictor of suidicde is a prior suicide attempt.

-   Firearm ownership is heavily associated with homicide.

-   Conditions that we don't expect to resolve in a short time - do not observe patient in ED

-   In all cases, exclude medical or substance-use cause of psychiatric symptoms before diagnosing a truely psychological condition.

-   Deliver bad-news at a face-to-face visit in a comfortable setting - allow physician to repond to nonverbal aspects of communication and provide empathy and emotional support as needed. It is also important to assess the patient's understanding of the condition, and how much the patient actually wants to know. Other steps include gaining an understanding of cultural/educational/religious issues, making medical information understandable to patient, and formulating a collaborative treatment plan. (SPIKES protocol)

-   Help-rejecting patients who are hopeless about treatment can lead physicians to become frustrated and confrontational and to desire to refer the patient to another provider. Clear expression of empathy and a collaborative approach with limited goals are the most effective appraoches.

-   Decisions about whether to accept gifts from patients include the cost, type, and timing of the gift and the motivation behind giving it. Gifts should not be accepted from patients experiencing a mood episode potentially affecting their judgement.

-   Treatment

    -   Acute bipolar depression: second generation antipsychotic quetiapine / lurasidone and anticonvulsant lamotrigine

    -   Maintenance treatment: lithium (reduce risk of suicide) and valproate

        -   Lifelong maintenance for those with severe course e.g. frequent episode, suicide attempts, severe symptoms, hospitalizatino

        -   Discontinuing stable treatment usually leads to a new mood episode within a year

        -   If patient insists on switching, cross taper to another antimanic agent

        -   If no oral medication is desired, taper over weeks to months and monitor frequently to identify early signs and symptoms of recurrence

    -   Avoid antidepressant therapy in patients with Bipolar I disorder due to the risk of antidepressant-induced switch from depression to mania; other risks of using antidepressants in patients with bipolar depression include the development of rapid cycling ( mood episodes / year) and increased mood cycle frequency.

        -   low energy,

        -   impaired concentration

        lasting **weeks**

    -   No history of mania or hypomania

    -   Leaden paralysis and mood reactivity for atypical depression

    -   Low cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), a metabolite of serotonin, is associated with suicidal behavior

-   Management

    -   Screen for history of hypomania or mania to rule out bipolar disorder before initiating therapy

    -   Anti-depressants:

        -   If SSRI failed as an initial treatment switch to another antidepressant

        -   The can be a different SSRI or another first line antidepressant with a different mechanism of action e.g. SNRI or bupropion, mirtazapine, or serotonin modulators (e.g. vilazodone)

        -   Note that bupropion is contraindicated for patients with active or historical bulimia or anorexia nervosa because of potential electrolyte disturbances; it is also contraindicated in patients with seizure.

        -   If switching from fluoxetine to a MAOI (e.g. phenelzine), allow for a wash out period of at least 5 weeks. This is because fluoxetine has a long half-life. For other anti-depressants, 2 weeks washout period is sufficient.

    -   ECT for patients with severe depression who are unresponsive to other therapies, in need of emergency treatment, or refuse to eat or drink

    -   MDD with psychotic features: antidepressnat plus antipsychotic; OR ECT

    -   Note that all anti-depressants have the potential of inducing mania in susceptible patients. The first step in management is discontinuation of the offending medication.

    -   For first episode, maintain treatment until 6 months symptom free

    -   Long term maintenance therapy is required

        -   episodes - maintenance antidepressant therapy for 1-3 years

        -   Suicidality

        -   Presence of ongoing psychosocial stressors

        -   Persistent residual depressive symptoms / chronic depressive episodes (\>2 years)

### Major Depressive Disorder with Seasonal Pattern

Also known as seasonable affective disorder

-   Clinical feature

    -   fall-winter onset and spring-summer remission

    -   Characterized by atypical features of depression such as

    -   Detailed menstrual history (diary) with prospective charting of daily mood and physical symptoms over the course of 2 or 3 menstrual cycles is commonly used

    -   Demonstrate that symptoms occur repeatedly and predictably prior to menstruation and resolves with menses confirms the diagnosis

    -   If symptoms occur irregularly or throughout the menstrual cycle, a primary mood or personality disorder is more likely

-   Management

    -   Exercise and stress reduction

    -   first line for moderate to severe PMS/PMDD: SSRI e.g. fluoxetine

    -   Cognitive behavior therapy has mixed results, may help to reduce affective symptoms and preoccupation with physical symptoms in patients who wish to avoid medication.

-----------------

### Separation Anxiety Disorder

### Selective Mutism

### Specific Phobia

-   Clinical feature

    -   10% of the population

### Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)

-   Diagnosis

    -   Anxiety restricted to social and performance situations, fear of scrutiny and embarrassment

    -   If the symptoms occur only in performance-related conditions, this is the performance only subtype of SAD; this could be mistaken for specific phobia

### Dhat Syndrome

-   Clinical Features

    -   Culture-bound syndrome found in South Asian cultures

    -   sufferers attribute a range of psychological and somatic complaints to the loss of semen via various methods (e.g. loss in urine, excess masturbation)

### Agoraphobia

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related disorders
------------------------------------------

### Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

-   Clinical features

    -   Obesssions: recurrent, intrusive, anxiety provoking thoughts, urges, or images

    -   Compulsions: response to obsessions with repeated behaviors or mental acts; the behaviors are not connected realistically with preventing feared event

    -   Time-consuming (\>1hr/day) or causing significant distress or impairment

-   Treatment

    -   Mild: CBT - exposure and response prevention

    -   Moderate to severe: SSRI as first line

    -   If respond poorly to monotherapy, use a combination of a serotonergic agent and an antipsychotic.

Note: pregnancy and postpartum period are associated with increased risk for new onset, recurrence, or exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Obsesssions and compulsions frequently center around fears of contaminatinng and harming the baby.

### Body Dysmorphic Disorder

-   Clinical features

    -   Preoccupation with perceived physical defects

    -   Defects not observable or appear slight to others

    -   Repetitive behavior or mental acts performed in response to the preoccupation

    -   Significant distress or impairment

    -   Variable insight (good, poor, absent/delusional beliefs)

-   Management

    -   Acknowledge the patient's distress, focus on impairment without validating or dismissing the patient's beliefs to establish a therapeutic alliance and lay the foundation for educating the patient about her condition and treatment options.

    -   Antidepressants (SSRI)

    -   Cognitive-behavioral therapy

### Hoarding Disorder

-   Management

    -   CBT

    -   SSRI may be considered as an adjunct, not very effective but helpful in treating comorbid depression and anxiety disorders.

### Trichotillomania

### Excoriation

Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders
--------------------------------------------------

### Oppositional Defiant Disorder

Compared to conduct disorder, the symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder are less severe and do not include stealing or aggression toward people. ODD can precede the development of conduct disorder, and increases the risk of adult antisocial behavior, impulse control problems, substance abuse, anxiety, and depression.

-   Diagnosis

    -   Presents with an irritable mood accompanied by vindictiveness and defiance of rules which is deliberate in nature rather than a result of emotional distress for months

        -   Argues with adults, defies authority figures, refuses to follow rules

        -   Deliberately annoys others

        -   Blames others for own mistakes or misbehavior

        -   Easily annoyed, angry, resentful, or vindictive

        -   Not due to another mental disorder

-   Treatment

    -   Parent management training

    -   Psychotherapy (anger management, social skills training)

    -   No pharmacotherapy for ODD but assess for comorbid ADHD and treat if present

### Intermittent Explosive Disorder

-   Clinical features

    -   Impulsive, aggressive behavior

    -   Verbal or physical aggression that is out of proportion to the provocation

    -   Short lived rage episodes lasting \< 30 minutes - in contrast to manic episodes which last weeks to months

    -   Followed by an immediate sense of relief that is usually followed by regret, dysphoria, and embarrassment

    -   Significant functional impairment

-   Management

    -   CBT

    -   SSRI

### Conduct Disorder

### Pyromania

### Kleptomania

### Other specified Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders

### Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders

Personality Disorders
---------------------

Note that PDs CANNOT be diagnosed in youth (before 18 year old), during which personalities are still developing! They have to be PERVASIVE.

### Cluster A - Odd and eccentric Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal

L2in\|L4in Paranoid & suspicious, distrustful, hypervigilant\
Schizoid & prefers to be a loner, detached, unemotional\
Schizotypal & unusual thoughts, perception, and behavior

### Cluster B - Dramatic and erratic Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, Narcissistic

#### Antisocial Personality Disorder

-   Clinical feature

    -   Violates rights of others, social norms, laws

    -   Impulsive, irritable, aggressive (fights, assults)

    -   Consistently irresponsible, lies, is deceitful (blames others for failure)

    -   Lack of remorse with the goal of gaining an advantage or intimidating others

    -   Age and evidence of conduct disorder before age 15

-   Management

    -   Psychotherapy for milder forms (monitor for manipulation of therapeutic relationship)

    -   Treat comorbid psychiatric disorders (e.g. substance use, depression)

#### Borderline PD

-   Clinical Features

    -   Characterized by a lifelong pattern of unstable interpersonal relationships, inappropirate anger, reccurent suicidal behavior, impulsivity, and abandonment fears.

    -   Patients with BPD often have a history of childhood trauma or abuse.

    -   Symptoms will manifest by early adulthood.

-   Treatment

    -   Primary treatment is psychotherapy

    -   Adjunct pharmacotherapy to target mood instability and transient psychosis - second gen antipsychotic and mood stabilizers

    -   Antidepressants if comorbid mood or anxiety disorders

#### Histronic

-   Clinical features

    -   Superficial, theatrical, attention-seeking

    -   Do not display emotional coldness or lack of empathy

    -   Instead exhibits excessive emotionality, overestimate the closeness of relationships and use seductive behavior to get their needs met.

#### Narcissistic

-   Clinical features:

    -   Grandiosity - charming and successful to obtain constant attention and praise.

    -   Sense of entitlement - Often demanding, arrogant and boastful, display an exaggerated sense of self-importance and frequently overestimates their abilities and.

    -   Need for admiration accomplishments - often disappointed in relationship when their needs to be admired and to be the center of attention are not met

    -   Lack of empathy - difficult sustaining relationships because they are unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others

### Cluster C - Anxious and Fearful Avoidant, Dependent, Obsessive-Compulsive

#### Avoidant PD

-   Avoid social interactions due to a sense of inadequacy and concern about negative evaluation.

-   Pattern is pervasive across settings and evident by early adulthood

-   Avoidant PD longs for acceptance but schizoid doesn't

#### Dependent

-   Clinical features:

    -   Avoid taking initiatives due to feelings of inadequacy

#### Obsessive-compulsive

-   Clinical features

    -   Rigid, controlling, perfectionistic

    -   This differs from OCD because OCD is marked by true obsessions that cause anxiety and result in compulsive, ritualistic behaviors performed to decrease it. In contrast, the OCPD, the distress is related to pervasive need for control and perfection rather than specific obsessions or compulsions.

    -   OCD patients typically have ego-dystonic beliefs and are distressed by their symptoms but OCPD patients have ego-syntonic beliefs and are comfortable with these behaviors and is confident that they indicate superiority.

### Other Personality Disorder

-   Personality change due to another medical condition

-   General personality disorder

-   Other specified personality disorder

Gender Dysphoria
----------------

Gender identity can be fluid and evolving, and gender dysphoria in early childhood does not always persist. However, when an intense, persistent desire to be another gender is experienced through adolenscence, this is more likely to be enduring and require further evaluation.

Paraphilic Disorders
--------------------

### Voyeuristic Disorder

### Exhibitionistic Disorder

### Frotteuristic Disorder

Frotteurism is a paraphilic interest in rubbing, usually one's pelvic area or erect penis, against a non-consenting person for sexual pleasure. It may involve touching any part of the body, including the genital area.

### Sexual Masochism Disorder

### Sexual Sadism Disorder

### Pedophilic Disorder

### Fetishistic Disorder

### Transvestic Disorder

Transvestism is a paraphilia in which an individual experiences recurrent, intense sexual arousal from cross-dressing, or dressing as the opposite gender, and in which that person's urge to do so causes significant distress or impairment in his or her daily life.

Somatic Symptoms and Related Disorders
--------------------------------------

### Somatic Symptom Disorder

Excessive preoccupation with **unexplained somatic symptoms** lasting for months.

-   Clinical features

    -   somatic symptom causing distress and functional impairment

    -   Excessive thoughts of behaviors related to somatic symptoms

        -   Unwarranted, persistent thoughts about seriousness of symptoms

        -   Persistent anxiety about health or symptoms

        -   Excessive time and energy devoted to symptoms

    -   months in duration

-   Management

    -   Regularly scheduled visits with the same provider

    -   Limit unnecessary workup and specialist referral

    -   Focus on stress reduction and coping strategies

    -   Mental health referral if patients will accept

### Illness Anxiety Disorder

Illness anxiety disorder (previously known as hypochondriasis) is characterized by excessive worrying over having or developing a serious illness while having **very mild or nonexistent somatic symptoms**.

### Conversion Disorder - Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder

Characterized by sudden onset of **neurological symptoms** with clinical findings that are incompatible with recognized neurological conditions. Conversion disorder is often precipitated by stress. e.g. psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES)

-   Clinical features

    -   Neurological symptoms (e.g. weakness / paralysis, nonepileptic seizures, sensory disturbances)

    -   Not intentionally produced (contracy to factitious disorder or malingering)

    -   Findings are incompatible with recognized neurological conditions

    -   Symptoms cause significant functional impairment

    -   Often precipitated by psychological stressor

-   Diagnosis

    -   PNES - gold standard is video-electroencephalogram

-   Management

    -   Education about the disorder

    -   Cognitive-behavioral therapy

    -   Physical therapy for motor symptoms

### Factitious Disorder

The intensional production of physical or psychological symptoms with the goal of assuming a sick role. There needs to be a motivation for doing so. It is different from malingering, which is the intensional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms. While both involves external incentives, in malingering the symptoms are exaggerated.

### Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions

Eating and Elimination Disorders
--------------------------------

L1.5 in\|L2 in \| L2 in Anorexia Nervosa & BMI \<18.5 kg/m2, intense fear of weight gain, distorted views of body weight and shape, osteoporosis, amenorrhea, lanugo, hair loss, dry skin, enlarged parotid glands, hypotension, hypothermia, bradycardia, cardiac atrophy, arrhythmias & CBT, nutritional rehabilitation, **olanzapine** if no response to first line\
Bulimia Nervosa & Recurrent episodes of binge eating, and inappropriate compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain, excessive worrying about body shape and weight & CBT, nutritional rehabilitation, SSRI often used in combination with first-line treatment\
Binge-eating disorder & recurrent episodes of binge eating without **inappropriate** compensatory behaviors & In order of preferance

1.  CBT

2.  behavioral weight loss therapy

3.  SSRI or stimulate lisdexamfetamine or antiepileptic topiramate

\
Body dysmorphic disorder & intense preoccupation with a perceived defect in physical appearance & not diagnosed in individual preoccupied with weight gain\

### Pica

Often seen in pregnancy, especially in association with iron deficiency anemia.

### Rumination Disorder

### Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder

-   Diagnostic Criteria

    -   An eating or feeding disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in eating or food; avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of food; concern about aversive consequences of eating) as manifested by persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs associated with one (or more) of the following:

        -   Significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in children)

        -   Significant nutritional deficiency

        -   Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements.

        -   Marked interference with psychosocial functioning.

    -   The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food or by an associated culturally sanctioned practice.

    -   The eating disturbance is not attributable to a concurrent medical condition or not better explained by another mental disorder. When the eating disturbance occurs in the context of another condition or disorder, the severity of the eating disturbance exceeds that routinely associated with the condition or disorder and warrants additional clinical attention

### Anorexia Nervosa

-   Clinical Features

    -   intense fear of eating

    -   significant loss of body weight (\<85% expected BMI)

    -   inaccurate perception of body image

    -   amenorrhea - due to loss of pulsatile GnRH release from hypothalamus which occurs when the level of body fat falls below a certain critical level. If left untreated, low estrogen levels in amenorrheic individuals could lead to osteoporosis.

-   Treatment

    -   Psychotherapy (individual, family, group)

    -   Nutritional rehabilitation

    -   Olanzepine if severe / refractory

-   Indications for Hospitalization

    -   Bradycardia (\<40 /min), dysrhythmia

    -   Hypotension (\<80/60 mmHg), orthostasis

    -   Hypothermia (\<35 C)

    -   Electrolyte disturbance, marked dehydration

    -   Organ compromise (renal, hepatic, cardiac)

    -   \<70% expected weight (BMI \<15 kg/m2)

### Bulimia Nervosa

-   Clinical Feature

    -   Concern about weight gain

    -   alternating binging and weight reduction behaviors

    -   bilateral parotid gland enlargement

    -   erosion of tooth enamel

    -   bloating and constipation

    -   irregular menses

    -   tachycardia, hypotension, dry skin

    -   metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia (renal losses of potassium in setting of alkalosis) and hypochloremia

-   Diagnosis

    -   Hypokalemia in otherwise healthy young adult is concerning for BN

    -   Based on clinical features

    -   In comparison with hypothyroidism, patients have tachycardia as opposed to bradycardia, hypotension as opposed to diastolic hypertension

### Binge-Eating Disorder

### Enuresis

### Encopresis

Sleep-Wake Disorders
--------------------

Consider insomnia problems, hypersomnolence problems, breathing related problems, parasomnias, and sleep-wake problems.

### Normal Aging

Changes in sleep architecture during aging include

-   Increased nighttime sleep onset latency

-   Decreased REM latency and slow-wave sleep.

-   Decreased total sleep time with peak sleepiness occuring earlier in the evening, nocturnal awakenings, reduced sleep during early-morning hours, and daytime napping/reduced daytime sleep latency.

Note that

-   Elderly are at particularly high risk of adverse effects from hypnotic medications e.g. delirium, impaired cognition, oversedation, falls and fracture - avoid benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics.

### Insomnia Disorder

-   Treatment

    -   Sleep restriction - for patients with insomnia who spend too much non-sleeping time in bed

    -   Ramelteon, melatonin agonist for sleep-onset insomnia, is safe in older adults

    -   Melatonin have some, limited, efficacy in treatment of circadian rhythm disorders.

### Hypersomnolence Disorder

### Narcolepsy

Epidemiology

-   Typical onset in early 20s

Diagnosis

-   Recurrent lapses into sleep or naps ( times /week for 3 months)

-   of the following

    -   Cataplexy: brief loss of muscle tone precipitated by strong emotion

    -   Low / undetectable level of hypocretin in CSF

        -   These are neuropeptides in lateral hypothalamus

        -   Hypocretin promote wakefulness and inhibit REM sleep related phenomenon

    -   Shortened REM sleep latency - polysomnography

-   A/w hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis

Management

-   First line: Modafinil

    -   non-amphetamine medication that promote wakefulness

    -   reduces daytime sleepiness, generally well-tolerated, and has less abuse potential than traditional stimulants

-   Second line: amphetamine, methylphenidate

    -   Useful but more chance for abuse

    -   Risk of adverse effects: HTN, tachycardia, psychosis, anorexia

-   If there is significant cataplexy, use REM sleep-suppressing drugs, including antidepressants and sodium oxybate.

-   AVOID sedating drugs

### Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea

-   Clinical feature

    -   Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (aka Pickwickian Syndrome) differs from OSA in that it has ABG changes.

    -   Can present with depressive symptoms: fatoigue, sleep disturbances with multiple awakenings, impaired concentration, irritability, and low mood

    -   STOP-Bang survey for obstructive sleep apnea risk

        -   Snoring

        -   Excessive daytime tiredness

        -   Observed apnears or choking / gasping

        -   High blood pressure

        -   BMI \> 35 kg/m2

        -   Age \>50

        -   Necksize: men \> 17 in, women \>16 in

        -   Male gender

        0-2 low; 3-4 intermediate; 5-6 high risk

-   Complication

    -   Pulmonary and systemic HTN: Apneic episodes result in hypercapnia and hypoxemia; these result in reflex systemic and pulmonary vasoconstrictions + SNS cardiac stimulation. When prolonged result in HTN.

### Central Sleep Apnea

### Sleep-related Hypoventilation

### Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorder

#### delayed sleep-wake phase disorder

Characterized by a bedtime that is shifted later than desired with subsequent difficulty awakening at a socially, scholastically, or professionally mandataed time, which results in shortened total sleep duration.

#### hypersomnolence disorder

Diagnosed only when there is no better explaination.

### NREM Arousal Disorders - sleep terror

A type of parasomnia most commonly seen in children age 2-12, with a peak incidence at age 5 -7. In healthy children with classic presentation, the diagnosis is clinical and no further workup is required.

-   Clinical features

    -   Abrupt arousals from sleep (panicked scream, terror,autonomic arousal, unresponsive to comfort)

    -   Last for minutes

    -   Little or no dream recall (unlike nightmare disorder)

    -   Amnesia for episodes

    -   Typically in the first half of the night

-   Management

    -   Reassurance - typically resolve spontaneously within 1 - 2 years

    -   Administer low-dose benzo at bedtime if episodes are frequent, persistent, and distressing

### Nightmare Disorder

-   Clinical features

    -   Vivid recall of disturbing dream content

    -   NOT associated with motor activity or sleep-related injury

    -   Fully alert, remembers the dream, and can usually be consoled

    -   Nightmares occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and are more frequent in the second half of the night

### REM Sleep Behavior Disorder

Normal REM sleep is characterized by muscle atonia. However, in RBD, degeneration of the brainstem nuclei responsible for inhibiting spinal motor neurons during normal REM sleep leads to incomplete or absent muscle atonia, facilitating dream enactment behaviors.

-   Clinical feature

    -   Often in older adult men

    -   Characterized by complex motor behavior that occur during REM sleep

    -   More likely to happen in the latter half of the night, when the percentage of REM sleep is ihgher

    -   Patient enact dreams

    -   Can be awaken fairly easily and are alert and oriented

    -   They cannot recall their movements during sleep but can often recall their dreams

    -   If recurrent and frequent, it may be prodromal sign of neurodegeneration with risk of subsequent onset of Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies; therefore RBD is frequently accompanied by prodromal signs/symptoms of neurodegeneration such as subtle motor deficits, anosomia, or constipation.

    -   May also be associated with narcolepsy and antidepressant medication initiation.

### Restless Legs Syndrome

-   Clinical feature

    -   Overwhelming urge to move the legs and is commonly associated with sleep disturbance and involuntary, jerking movements of legs during sleep

    -   Would not explain this patient's dream enactment with complex motor behaviors.

### Substance/Medication-induced Sleep Disorder

-------------------

### Delayed Ejaculation

### Erectile Disorder

### Female Orgasmic Disorder

### Female Sexual Interest / Arousal Disorder

### Genito-Pelvic Pain / Penetration Disorder

### Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder

### Premature Ejaculation

### Substance / Medication Induced Sexual Dysfunction

----------------------

Substance-related and Addictive Disorders
-----------------------------------------

List of Substances to Looks For

-   Caffeine

-   Alcohol

-   Tobacco

-   Cannabis

-   Opioid

-   Sedataive-, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic

-   Stimulant

-   Inhalant

-   Hallucinogen

### Alcohol Related Diseases

#### Alcohol Abuse

Definition of alcohol use problem is by negative health effects. This has been found for

-   women of all ages and men age who consume \> 7 drinks in a week or \> 3 in a day

-   for men age \< 65, the cutoff are \>14 drinks in a week or \>4 drinks in a day.

Presentation

-   Sleep disturbance

-   Anxiety from mild withdrawal

Diagnosis

-   By alcohol consumption pattern

-   Abnormal liver enzymes (Aspartate aminotransferase / Alanine amino transferase ratio :1)

-   Macrocytosis

-   Alcohol tolerance

-   Impaired functioning

-   A/W GERD, HTN, tremor

#### Management of Alcohol Use Disorder

-   Psycosocial interventions

-   Pharmacotherapy

    -   1st line: naltrexone, mu-opioid receptor antagonist; and acamprosate, a glutamate modulator

        -   Naltrexone decrease alcohol craving, reduce heavy drinking days (\>5 drinks for men and \>4 for women) and increased days of abstinence

        -   Naltrexone can be initiated in patients who are still drinking but contraindicated in patients with acute hepatitis, liver failure, or taking opioids because it can precipitate withdrawal

        -   Acamprosate is primarily used to maintain abstinence, and should be avoided in patients with renal impairment

    -   2nd line: aversive agent disulfram, which is an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor

        -   It causes unpleasant physiologic reaction (tachycardia, flushed skin, headache, nausea, vomiting) when alcohol is consumed

        -   Can only be used in abstinent patients who are highly motivated or take the medication in a supervised setting

#### Alcohol Withdrawal and Delirium Tremens

Untreated alcohol withdrawal can progress; delirium tremens can be fatal in up to 5% of the cases and should be treated with benzodiazepine. In particular, in the hospital setting, lorazepam, an intermediate-duration benzodiazepine that can be given intravenously is preferred. It is also safer in patients with decreased liver function. Anticonvulsant phenobarbital has also been used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines in treatment-refractory alcohol withdrawal and withdrawal-related seizures.

L2 in\|L 2 in\|L2 in Manifestations & Symptoms / Signs & Onset Since Last Drink\
Mild withdrawal& Anxiety, insomnia, tremors, diaphoresis, palpitations, GI upset, intact orientation & 6 - 24\
Seizures & Single or multiple generalized tonic-clonic & 12-48\
Alcohol hallucinosis& Visual, auditory, or tactile; intact orientation; stable vital signs & 12 - 48\
Delirium Tremens & Confusion, agitation, fever, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, hallucinations & 48 - 96\

Patients with alcohol withdrawal also require frequent monitoring of vital signs, thiamine, folate, and nutritional support.

#### Korsakoff Syndrome

A potential complication of Wernicke encephalopathy (WE), which is an acute disorder of thaimine deficiency characterized by the classic triad of encephaloapthy, ataxia, and oculomotor dysfunction. Although WE may be seen in conditions affecting oral intake other than alcohol use disorder (e.g. anorexia, hyperemesis gravidarum), the risk of WE progressing to KS is much higher in alcohol use disorder than in other WE-associated conditions.

-   Pathology

    -   Lesions in the anterior and medial thalami, as well as corpus callosum

    -   This is in contrast to WE with mamillary body atrophy and dorsomedial thalamic neuron loss

-   Clinical feature

    -   Retrograde and antegrade amnesia

    -   Confabulation, apathy, lack of insight

    -   KS may develop without a recognized acute episode of WE

    -   Patients may experience a significant recovery of function WE with thiamine supplementation, but recovery is rare in KS!

#### Marchiafava-Bignami disease

Severe damage to the corpus callosum and surrounding white matter in the context of chronic alcohol use disorder and attendant malnutrition.

-   Clinical feature: dementia, motor dysfunction, dysarthria

Also note that standard urine screens do not detect semisynthetic (e.g. hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone) or snythetic (e.g. fentanyl, meperidine, methadone, tramadol) opioids.

### Amphetamine Intoxication

-   Clinical Features

    -   delusions, tactile hallucinations, aggressive behavior, severe insomnia, mood disturbances

    -   physical findings of poor dentition, bruxism, and skin sores or excoriations due to chronic skin picking, sympathetic overactivity (elevated pulse and BP, hyperthermia, pupillary dilation)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Decongestant pseudoephedrine and antidepresants bupropion and selegiline can cause false positives for amphetamine on urine toxicology testing.

-   Newer synthetic cathinones may not be detectable on routine toxicology screens.

### Inhalant Abuse

Commonly abused inhalants include glue, toluene, nitrous oxide, amyl nitrite, and spray paints. They may be abused by sniffing, huffing (inhaled from a saturated cloth), or bagging (bag over mouth or nose) to concentrate the inhaled substance

-   Signs of acute intoxication

    -   Transient euphoria

    -   Loss of consciousness

    -   Other chemical specific effects e.g. NO - vitamin B12 deficiency and polyneuropathy

-   Inhalants are highly lipid soluble, and produce immediate effects that typically last 15-45 minutes. They acts as CNS depressants and may cause death

-   Dermatitis (glue sniffer's rash) due to chemical exposure can be seen around mouth or nostrils.

-   Elevated LFT with repeated use

-   Boys age 14 - 17 are at highest risk for inhalant abuse

-   May go unnoticed because common household products are used and no drug paraphernalia is found

### Withdrawal Syndromes

-   Clinical feature: characteristics related to problematic gambling

    -   preoccupation with gambling

    -   frequent return to gambling to attempt to recover past losses

    -   Participation in self-help programs

Medication-related Disorders
----------------------------

### Extrapyramidal symoptom associated with antipsychotics

L1 in \| L3 in \| L2 in Effect & Description & Pharmacotherapy\
Parkinsonism & Gradual-onset tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia & benztropine, amantadine\
Acute dystonia & Sudden sustained contraction of the neck, mouth, tongue and eye muscles & benzotropine, diphenhydramine\
Akathisia & Subjective restlessness, inability to sit still & beta blocker (propanolol), benzo (lorazepam), benztropine\
Tardive dyskinesia & Gradual onset after prolonged therapy (\>6 months): dyskinesia of the month, face, trunk, and extremities; Due to D2 receptor upregulation and supersensitivity from chronic blockage OR imbalance between D1 and D2 in basal ganglia, as well as excitotoxic destruction of GABA neurons in the striatum & Valbenazine, deutetrabenazine\

-   Treatment

    -   Propranolol

### Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

This is a potentially lethal reaction to antipsychotic medications. Althogh NMS is not fully understood and the involvement of multiple neurotransmitters has been proposed, it is thought to be primarily due to dysregulation of dopamine caused by D2 receptor antagonism. Dopamine antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway may lead to diffuse lead pipe rigidity seen in NMS. D2 antagonism is the mechanism of action of all first-generation and most second generation antipsychotics.

-   Clinical Features

    -   fever, confusion, **muscle rigidity**, autonomic instability

    -   lab: elevated creatine phosphokinase level and WBC

    -   use of neuroleptic agents e.g. haloperidol, promethazine

    -   develop over course of days, typically in the first 2 weeks of treatment

-   Complication

    -   Acute renal failure due to myoglobinuria

-   Management

    1.  Stop antipsychotic or restart dopamine agents

    2.  Supportive care (hydration, cooling) in ICU

    3.  Dantrolene (muscle relaxant) or bromocriptine / amantadine (dopaminergic agents) if refractory

### Serotonin Syndrome

Happens when MAOIs are combined with serotonergic antidepressants, illicit substances, or other medications with serotonergic effects (SSRI, meperidine etc.)

-   Clinical features

    -   Characterized by a triad of

        -   Autonomic instability - diaphoresis, hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, dilated pupils

        -   Altered mental status - agitated delirium

        -   Neuromuscular irritability e.g. **hyperreflexia**, myoclonus, tremor

    -   A/W vomiting, hyperactive bowel sounds

-   Management

    1.  Prevention by stopping all antidepressants for 2 weeks before beginning MAOI (exception is fluoxetine, which should be discontinued for at least 5 weeks).

    2.  Cyproheptadine - serotonin antagonist

### Lithium Toxicity

-   Etiology

    -   Acute - intentional overdose

    -   Chronic - decreased renal perfusion due to dehydration or medication (thiazide, NSAIDs, ACEi)

-   Clinical features

    -   Acute: GI disturbance, vomiting, diarrhea, with late neurological sequelaw

    -   Chronic: letharguy, confusion, agitation, ataxia, tremor / fasciculations, seizure

-   Management

    -   IV hydration (dilution) if mild

    -   Hemodialysis if severe (lithium level \>2.5 mEq/L and prominent signs of toxicity)

### TCA Overdose

-   Clinical feature

    -   Mental status changes, seizures

    -   Tachycardia, hypotension, cardiac conduction delay (blockage of fast Na channels, lead to QRS prolongation)

    -   Anticholinergic effects: dilated pupils, hyperthermia, flushed and dry skin, intestinal ileus

-   Management

    -   QRS \>100msec is associated with increased risk for ventricular arrhythmia, and seizures, and is used as an indication for sodium bicarbonate therapy

### Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome

-   Clinical feature

    -   Begins 2 - 4 days after abruptly stopped or rapidly tapered medication

    -   Abrupt onset of dysphoria

    -   Fatigue

    -   Dizziness

    -   Gastrointestinal distress

    -   Flu-like symptoms

-   Management

    -   Reinstitute the same antidepressant and taper the dose gradually over 2 - 4 weeks or longer in severe cases.

    -   Alternative to managing SSRI discontinuation is to substitute fluoxetine which is more easily tapered due to its long half-life.
