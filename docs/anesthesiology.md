Anesthesia service

-   Pre-op clinic

-   Intra-operation

    -   Induction

    -   Maintainance

    -   Emergence

Pilot analogy is flawed because you wouldn't fly it if it is flawed.

There is in general a huge number of surgeries being done. This is also increasing because of aging population.

Mortality from anesthesia has decreased significantly, due to advancement of anesthesia, patient safety etc. So now we say anesthesia is safe but surgery can be dangerous!! SGH 1 year mortality rate is 3.5%. The rate is very high on specific groups of patient. The pre-op assessment should help us identify these people and understand if we can do anything to mitigate their risk.

Difference between anesthesia and other disciplines

-   If you are a patient, what do you expect from a good doctor? Diagnosis is key!

-   Anesthesia is not part of treatment of primary diagnosis; so patients will be very unhappy if anesthesiologists screw up. So what added value do we provide for patients?

    -   Pain management intra-op and peri-op

    -   Comfort / anxiety, not too hot, not too cold

    -   Patient safety - physiology (haemodynamic stability)

    Our job is to give poison, the philosophy should be as little as possible, as simple as possible. Inhalation is better than IV.

### Intraop Care

Safety of anesthesia machine

-   CO2 monitoring - capnography baseline will not go back to zero (more objective), sodalime will change color

-   Oxygen reservoir - psi meter;

-   Alarms - supply of oxygen,

-   Amount of oxygen given; there is an oxygen sensor

    -   usual FiO2 is around 30%, during surgery there is atelectasis increased shunt

    -   ARDS is when shunt is increased to 60 - 70% even increasing FiO2 to 100% would not work.

    -   21- 25% machine goes off; Set to 30 - 40% typically, may increase to 100%; target PaO2 above 80%. Splinting of the diagphram, and the lung doesn't expand as well, atelectasis, shunt fraction. As surgery goes along, the PaO2/FiO2 change, need to monitor this - pulse oximetry. Target O2 sat of more than 93%. Inflexion point is around 90% Hb Sat or 60 mmHg, stay on the flat side, so we know the patient is safe. Below 60 patient is unsafe because PaO2 falls too quickly.

-   Ratio controller - oxygen and nitrous oxide. In the older machine there is a chain that links these together. Cannot

-   All gases are delivered at much higher pressure and need to be stepped down to a level that is safe for the patient. Stepping down of the pressure is done by the machine.

-   Make sure there is no leak in the system, track the amount delivered and expired so we know what we are actually delivering to the patient.

Protocol for setting up

-   Check that oxygen tank is full

-   Follow machine protocol to go through all the checks of the machine; electrical machines are much easier to set-up than mechanical ones

Capnography

-   Samples end-tidal CO2; sampled right after the ETT, as close to the patient as possible

-   Reading a capnography for ETCo2

Venous Air Embolism: bottle concept

-   Neurosurgery, the cap of the bottle is open where the surgery is

-   If venous pressure is less than atmospheric pressure, air goes in. This is venous embolism.

-   Alternative is to flood the surgical field

Blood pressure management

-   No specific number, case specific

-   Case: spino-anesthesia induced hypotension: how? Three big things of the sympathetic system - vasoconstriction, heart rate, contractility; spinal anesthesia affect vasoconstriction first. Cardiac fiber is T4 and above, generally spinal is much lower, T12 and lower; so mainly vasodilation.

-   Give fluid is usually slow in vasodilation driven HoTN, give $\alpha$ - agonist while fluid is taking action. For spinal, especially ephedrine.

How to assess blood loss intra-op

-   Wash and blood are sucked up in a drain. Talk to scrub nurse how much did they give to surgeon

-   Blood on the gause: 10 gauze is 100 ml of blood loss

-   Every penny towel is 100 ml

-   Weigh the gauze before giving it to the surgeon

-   Check Hct $$\text{ABL} = \text{ECV} (\text{Hcti} - \text{Hctt})/\text{Hcti}$$ NEED TO VOLUME RESUSCITATE THE PATIENT BEFORE WE CAN GET THE HEMATOCRIT; but if over-do it, we might dilute it too much

Transfusion trigger - below 7 g/dL usually; This may be raised based on the comorbidities - and up to 9 g/dL. Work out the blood loss we can tolerate.

-   Colloids contain larger insoluble molecules - albumin, gelatin etc. Give 1:1

-   Crystalloids are solutions of mineral salts or other water-soluble molecules. Give 3:1

-   FFP - coagulation factor problem

-   Platelets - when the platelet function is poor

-   Packed Blood Cells -

-   Whole Blood -

Temperature monitoring in OT

-   Anesthetic drugs can affect thermoregulation of hypothalamus

-   Hyperthermia - too aggressive warming or maglinant hyperthermia

-   Hypothermia - cold OT, losing shivering, loss vasoconstriction s easy to get it; this affect clotting. Why keep OR cold - surgeon comfort, 20 - 24 to reduce infection.

    -   Warm fluids and air (inhaled, surrounding)

    -   Bair hugger

    -   Limit area of exposure

    -   Heat and moisture exchanger at the end of ETT

    -   Heated water bath

    -   Circuit recirculate the gas

    -   Low flow anesthesia

-   Delivery of desflurane, need vaporizer, that is heated, to allow its delivery in controlled fashion

### Hyperbaric Oxygen

-   Typical treatment

    -   Each treatment session lasts about 2 hours

    -   On the average, 20 to 30 sessions will be required

-   Benefits

    -   Hyperoxygenation

    -   

-   Treatment table

    -   Table RN62/USNTT6 - 180 kPa for 18 msw the

    -   Table RN61/USNTT5

    -   2.4 ATA treatment table

    -   2 ATA treatment table

-   Undersea and hyperbaric medical society has 15 approved indications

    -   Chronic wounds

    -   Delayed radiation injury

    -   Arterial gas embolise

    -   Decompression injury

-   Contraindication

    -   Untreated pneumothorax

    -   Bleomycin - severe interstitial pulmonitis

    -   Cisplatin

    -   Disulfiram

    -   Mafenide

    -   Doburoxin

-   Additional considerations

    -   theoretical risk to fetus in pregnancy but there is no consensus

    -   in congestive cardiac failure - may increase SVR and precipitate pulmonary edema

-   Complications and side effects

    -   Middle Ear Barotrauma (most common) - repeated barotrauma may result in ear effusion which usually resolves spontaneously; grommet tubes may be used to help or

    -   Sinus Barotrauma - esp frontal and maxillary sinuses, pain can be severe enough to abort treatment

    -   Ocular effects - worsening myopia after 15 sessions by 2 dioptres, return to pre-treatment levels 6 - 8 weeks;

-   Uncommon problems

    -   Pulmonary oxygen toxicity

    -   Central nervous system O2 toxicity - only if patient breath 100% oxygen at more than 1.4 AtA; rare with current treatment; grand mal seizure

    -   DEntal problems - pain due to air trapped under filling, need to re-do; more common in diving than HBO

    -   Numb fingers

    -   Gastrointestinal pain and discomfort

    -   Decompression illness

    -   Round window blowout

    -   Pulmonary barotrauma - depending on where the gas leak to;

-   HBOT for wound healing

    -   Some wounds don't heal due to inadequate oxygen

    -   HBOT is the only way to deliver safe therapeutic level of oxygen to wounds

    -   Does not replace conventional wound management

    -   Types of wounds that HBOT helps

        -   Diabetic lower extremity wounds

        -   Venous stasis ulcers

        -   Late radiation injury

        -   Arterial insuficiency ulcers

        -   Any wound that has failed to heal with conventional methods

    -   Wound not suitable for hBOT

        -   Malignant ulcers

        -   Decubitus/pressure ulcers

    -   Lower limb perfusion

        -   Tests used to identify hypoxia / ischemia

        -   TCOM transcutaneous oximetry with non-invasive assessment of skin-subject

        -   tcPO2 lower than 40 is hypoxia

        -   Response to 100% oxygen, if improvement is \<30%, it is problematic

    -   Faglia shows reduction in amputation rate, Another paper showed reduction in injury

    Remember Wagner score of foot ulcer;

### Questions

-   How much does 1 g of Hb carries? 1.34 ml of oxygen

-   How much O2 does 100 mls of arterial blood with Hb of 15 g% stores? 20 ml of O2

-   What is the total blood volume an adult person has? 5000 ml

-   Total amount of O2 stored with Hb of 15: 1000mls

-   With 1000ml of O2 available for use, we have only 4 minutes before brain dies. However, we actually have less than 4 minutes because venous blood is not fully saturated.

-   Where is O2 stored? in the Lung - functional residual capacity to be specific

-   250 ml/min O2 extracted in the body

Laryngoscopy View: a walk into the cave

-   Soft roof of the

-   Flower on the roof, only has a dorsal petal

-   Mactinosh blade lift the roof up and so the petal move up

-   Intubate into the petal

-   Miller blade lift the petal up - for peds mainly, with floppy epiglottis; epiglottis is by cranial nerve X

-   Vallecula is innervated by the Cranial Nerve IX, no brady

-   In peds give atropine before intubation, to prevent brady

-   NEver a midline affair

IV fluids - Volume Expander

-   Crystalloids: 3 to 4 for 1\
    substances which are easily crystallized from their aqueous solution

    -   Salt base (has sodium)

    -   Dextrose 5

    -   Ringer Solution

    -   Glucose

-   Colloids - 1 for 1

-   Pure dextrose - pure water with sugar - 12 for 1

Why is Sugar a problem

-   is an osmodiuretic - get diuresis, loss sodium and potassium.

-   wound infection is NOT a problem

-   if there is any period of hypoperfusion, high sugar might have problem during reperfusion

Why is Hypertension a problem

-   If undiagnosed, need to cancel, due to 20% chance of secondary HTN, this is treatable, and you don't have to risk it. Secondary HTN cannot resolve with anti-HTN, intra-op and post-op will be hard to control; especially post-op, due to pain and stress, the risk of MI or stroke is really high.

-   If on treatment, intraoperative, we can control

How to manage the patient

-   Understand the fear

-   Do not say \"when did you have your last meal\"? Last food, last drink?

-   Let patient hear the oxygen before letting them breath into the mask

-   Ask about meds to indirectly know about chronic conditions the patient has

Pre-operative Evaluation
------------------------

Reasons: risk assessment, risk counseling, risk mitigation (medical and functional)

-   Resuce risk of perop morbidity andmortality

-   Optimization of co-existing medical problems

-   Anticipate anesthetic issues and formulate anesthetic complications

Goals of preoperative anesthesia evaluation

-   establishing an excellent physician--patient relationship

-   obtaining a thorough medical history, reviewing the patient's medical records, including previous anesthetic records, if available

-   performing a physical exam, including a detailed airway assessment

-   ordering and reviewing pertinent tests and consultations

-   ordering appropriate preoperative medications

-   obtaining informed consent

Periooperative risk

-   Surgical risk

    -   Short term: pain

    -   Long term: chronic pain, stoma

-   Anesthetic risk

    -   Short term

    -   Long term

Common preventable complications after non-cardiac surgery

-   Pneumonia

-   Superficial and deep wound infection

-   MI

-   Arrthymia

-   Sever pain

-   PE

-   acute kidjkey injury

-   Stroke

-   respiratory failire

-   Acute confusion or delirium

-   Cardiac arrest

Why do patients develop opostop complications?

-   Procedure related: Failure in surgical or anesthetic technique

-   Patient related: Physiological, endocrine, and inflammatory changes asociated with the titsue injury of surgery

-   Chronic conditions that often affect postop outcome: e.g. diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and poor nutritional status

### Risk Assessment

Risk assessment of medical diseases and how comorbidity impact surgical outcome

-   Consider inherent surgical risk, prodecures are dividedintp low, intermediate, and high risk

-   Patient based risks are divided into fixed or modifiable; or innate (only fixed), acquired (fixed or modifiable), lifestyle (modifiable)

    -   Innate: age, gender, genetics

    -   Modifiable: various disease conditions

    -   Lifestyle: smoking, alcohol, diet, obesity/exercise

Combine the surgical risk and patient risk to generate the overall risk profile. We can use some risk calculators

-   NSQIP surgical risk calculator (US)

-   CARES surgical risk calculator (Singapore - Dr Hairil Abdullah)

Disease specific i.e. modifiable ones

-   Revised cardiac risk index

-   STOP-Bang Questionaire to Screen for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Patients with osa has higher risk of periop pulmonary complications, more sensitive to opioids, harder to intubate, post-op need CPAP, monitored in high-D or ICU

-   Patients with risks of Acute Kidney Injurt stop ACEi and ARB, hydrate more intra-operatively

-   Preoperative anemia - give IV Iron 1 - 2 weeks before surgery; reduce transfusion and complication rate

### Risk Counselling

Need to think what is it that a reasonable risk that someone would like to know about their surgical risk?

-   Consent form - reasonable patient standard

-   Particular patient standard - disease and procedure specific

### Risk Mitigation

-   Anemia

-   Smoking cessation - Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement Consensus Statement on Perioperative Smoking Cessation; Intervention should occur as soon as possible.

-   Frailty - state of decrease in physiological reserve; do physiotherapy before surgery, rate of postop complication reduces, stay in hospital shorten; this is the next frontier in peri-operative. Surgery is like a marathon, you don't just go for it, you prepare for it, exercise, change diet etc. How to bring down mobility and motality.

### Case Studies

#### Incidental pancreatic cancer with recent MI and poor bloor pressure control

Case: 65, male, smoker, hypertensive, diabeteic (HbA1c 8%) History of NSTEMI 1 month ago, found to have CA pancreas during workup, BMS x 3 inserted 2 weeks ago, on DAPT currently; Perioperative plan, risk discussions, action plan (further investigations, risk mitigation strategies, dapt?)

-   Surgical risk: greater than 5% mortality high risk surgery; bleeding, electrolyte imbalance, hypovolemia

-   Patient risk: cardiovascular disease, BM, smoking unknown pack years, pre-existing renal issues

-   Medical risk

-   Functional risk

What is the most important?

-   Re-thrombosis risk

-   MI related mortality

-   NSTEMI ejection fraction

Further investigation

-   2D echo for ejection fraction and signs of heart failure

-   ECG baseline for old infarcts

-   PT/PTT coagulation

-   Hb and platelet counts

Risk mitigation

-   stop smoking

-   control htn

-   blood glucose - HbA1c will not move in a few weeks, get blood glucose measurement and ensure tight control

-   keep dapt for 1 month, stop clevix and keep aspirin for 5 days, step

-   postpone the surgery to more than 6 weeks post NSTEMI; pancreas cancer is incidental finding.

#### Female with hip fracture

Case: 87, female fractured hip for DHS, Hx of HTN on atenolol, COPD on symbicort, Hb 8, mitigation strategy, timing of surgery

-   Use ASA class

-   Patient specific problem: hip fracture, COPD, HTN on atenolol, anemia, old age (poor kidney function, dementia, immunocompromised, fraility, medication side effect)

-   Timing of surgery - ASAP because comorbidities seem ok, want to get her ambulating asap; most die because of PE or pneumonia so it is very important to ambulate quickly

Pre-op

-   COPD - spirometry, continue meds, stop smoking if smoker

-   HTN - check BP, ensuer SBP \< 140, preop ECG, diastolic bp should be \< 110

-   Anemia - FBC, iron studies, vit B12, folate, mx Fe IV, GXM prep, consider iron transfusion

-   Old - check for creatinine clearance status, fallrisk

-   Medication recouncillation

-   Infection risk - prophylaxis abx

-   BMD scan

#### Liver Nodule

Case: 65 male diabetes HTN, smoker, singular liver nodule, Rt hepatectomy, history of CVA 2 months ago, ESM grade 4 radiating to carotid, risk mitigation strategy

-   Heart murmur is a big issue; need echo and EF

-   Related to CVA - might be syncope related to AS

-   Dangers of AS in anesthesia

    -   This is a fixed cardiac output lesion, we cannot push beyond a certain point

    -   Once we start induction, most anesthetic agent cause vasodilatation, a normal heart will increase HR to compensate for drop in SVR, and there will be hypoperfusion.

    -   Hypoperfusion result in acid production by tissue, which decreased cardiac contractility,

    -   Surgery also increase cardiac muscle oxygen demand, limited coronary perfusion may increase the chance of MI

    -   Cannot do effective CPR

-   Functional fixed output lesion such as pulmonary hypertension is also treated similarly as the AS Echo will inform us if we need to do a heart surgery first or do the hepatectomy first.

#### Mastectomy with Hx of Bronchiestasis

Case: 48 F CA brest for mastectomy and axillary clearance, history of cystic bronchiestasis and spontaneous pneumothorax (bilateral). What are the concerns and mitigation strategies.

-   Patient:

-   Disease: cystic bronchiestasis and spontaneous pneumothorax - cardiopulmonary consideration; recurrent infections and on chronic antibiotics - elective surgery need to be cleared of active infection. patient also have a lot of secretions, which will thicken on ventilators, and patients might choke on the secretions.

-   Procedure: Low risk surgery

Preop Strategies

-   Review any past surgical/ clinical notes for anesthesiology plans (interventions, complications, mitigation strategy)

-   Assess smoking history; counsel to stop smoking

-   Physical examination (auscultation for breath sounds, wheezes, etc)

-   Preop CXR, lung function test, baseline cardiopulmonary function (e.g. 6 minute walk test)-

-   Preoperative optimization of infection & bronchospasm with antibiotics, steroids, bronchodilators for patient with bronchiectasis

-   investigate with CBC and PT PTT first and then assess need to correct coagulability and anemia of Chronic dz if it's a problem? - FBC iron studies Vit B12, folate.

-   Nutrition assessment, labs albumin (nutritional status), renal panel (for assessment of type of anesthesia and also for subsequent fluid management) LFTs (If necessary)

-   echo assessment of pulmonary hypertension from bronchiectasis

Avoid general anesthesia is this patient!! Do epidural anesthesia at thoracic level. Good band of anesthesia across the chest.

#### ESRF pacemaker, need to do anterior resection

Case: 48 M ESRF on HD, pacemaker for SSS, lsited for anterior resection (CA colon), concerns, preparation, risk mitigation strategies

-   ASA IV

-   Moderate to high risk

-   ESRF

    -   Carefully titrate opioid use

    -   Dialysis need to happen at least 24 hous before surgery

    -   If within 6 hours, need to do heparin free dialysis

    -   Electrolyte - don't want hypokalemia in surgery

    -   Reduce metabolite level and chance of acidosis

    -   Frank starling curve as much as possible on the left - not overloaded in surgery

-   Pacemaker

    -   When was the last functional check within the past 6 months

    -   New arrhythmia and AF?

    -   Is the patient dependent on the pacemaker? If pacemaker doing 40% or more of the heart rhythm, then the patient is pacemaker dependent. Pacemaker may have oversensing from the cauterization devices, and stop pacing, patient get severe bradycardia and shock. There is a magnet that can be placed to change the mode of the pacemaker - making it into a fixed mode.

    -   Turn off the device - a AICD; implantable cardio defibrillator and replace with a pacing pad. This is an anti-tachy device, pace-maker is a anti-brady device. For defibrillator, if oversense, one will just get shocked all the time.

### Questions

Questions

-   If patient has poorly controlled diabetes, or similar chronic conditions, that require some time to adjust, who manages the patient? Surgeon to perioperative service is quite short, medium time, 2 - 3 weeks.

-   What have you discovered in designing the risk calculator that's the key difference between the US and Singapore population in terms of risks

-   What are the risks of transfusion?

    -   IV iron infusion 0.5 - 1 Hb per week

    -   Frality - good effect is 2 weeks or more

    -   Cardiac - beta blocker also need about 2 weeks

    Perioperative medicine involves not only anesthesiologists but also internal medicine specialists working in this area. Always have the option of postponing the surgery. Multidisciplinary.

-   Difference in smoking

### History and Physical

History components

-   Airway

    -   Modified Mallampati classification system - worry if III or IV

-   Cardiovascular

    -   Active cardiac condition or clinical risk?

    -   If not low-risk surgery, does the patient have god functional capcity without sumptoms\>

-   Pulmonary

-   Hepatic and gastrointestinal diease

-   Bleeding disorders

-   Endocrine

-   Renal

-   Neurologic

-   MSK

Physical exam Medications / allergies

### Anesthetic Plan

### Anesthesia Consent Form

Epidural Analgesia
------------------

Continuous epidural analgesia involves infusion of low concentration of a local anesthesia into the epidural space at L2 - L5 level, blocking nerves responsible for labor pain. It is a highly effective modality for pain relief in labor.

### Hypotension

Up to 10% of epidurals given during labor can cause hypotension. This happens when sympathetic nerve fibers responsible for vascular tone are blocked, resulting in vasodilation (venous pooling), decreased venous return to the right side of the heart, and decreased cardiac output.

-   Prevention: Aggressive intravenous fluid volume expansion prior to epidural placement

-   Treatment:

    -   left uterine displacement (positioning patient on the left) to improve venous return

    -   additional intravenous fluid bolus

    -   vasopressor administration

### High or Total Spinal

Depression of cervical spinal cord and brainstem activity when local anesthesia ascends towards the head. This is dangerous complication of epidural anesthesia. It may happen with intrathecal injection or overdose of the anesthesic.

-   Presentation

    -   Hypotension

    -   Bradycardia

    -   Respiratory difficulty

    -   Diaphragmatic paralysis

    -   Possibly cardiopulmonary arrest

Post Op Anesthesia Care
-----------------------

How do we manage the common post-op complications? Why do these complication happen? What kind of patients are at risk?

### PACU

Post-anesthesia care unit. Why do we not monitor the patients in the wards?

-   Anesthesia and surgery causes physiological changes in the body that doesn't return to normal right after the surgery;

-   Blood loss can happen quickly, near to the OR so patients can return to OR quickly if needed

What rare monitored

-   HR

-   Respiratory rate

-   SpO2

-   Post op pain

-   N/V

-   Mental Status

When is the patient ready for discharge to the ward? Use Modified Aldrete Scale

-   Mental state - patient alert, can follow command,

-   N/V and pain - under control

-   Vital signs - BP 20% baseline value,

This can be minutes to hours. PACC - higher level PACU, like step down ICU care.

### Respiratory Insufficiency

The condition in which the lungs cannot take in sufficient oxygen or expell sufficient carbon dioxide to meet the needs of the cells of the body. Case: Patient exhibiting Paradoxycal breathing - due to upper airway obstruction

-   Tripple manuvuver: Head tilt, chin lift, jaw thrust

-   Most common cause is if the tongue and soft tissue are still relaxed

Now the patient continues to desaturate - what other causes of upper airway obstruction are there?

-   For ENT tissue, there is a throat pad to suck up blood to prevent blood from going into the stomach; Direct larynoscopy shows a throat pad over the vocal pad; Sticker to remind us to remove throat pad

Removed throat pad, patient developed stridor breathing

-   Hematoma - children, upper palate repair; look for neck swelling

    -   Drain the hematoma

    -   Physical compression for hematoma in post-thyroid surgery on trachea unlikely to cause stridor, but the hematoma might compress on the blood vessels and lymphatics, leading to edema.

-   Laryngospasm - tend to happen in the light phase of anesthesia; get rapid desaturation; to manage laryngospasm

    -   positive pressure mask ventilation oral or nasal airway,

    -   suctioning

    -   small dose of succinylcholine if refractory

    -   intubation

    -   finally cricothyroidotomy or jet ventilation if the inability to intubate or ventilate is encountered

    -   Larson's procedure to stimulate taking a deep breath

-   Recurrent larygno nerve damage / vocal cord paralysis

    -   Both nerve need to be injured

-   Airway edema

Obstruction: inside, in the wall, outside the lumen

### Hypoxemia

Defined as PaO2 less than 60 mmHg or SpO2 less than 90%. Hypoxia is at the level of cells but not hypoxemia. Now we see a patient, we don't think has obstruction, but has hypoxemia:

-   Atelectasis

-   Pneumothorax

    -   Incision - subclavian central line incision

    -   Diaphgram damage

    -   Positive pressure ventilation rupture a bulla

    -   Nerve block

-   Pulmonary embolism

-   residual anestheticn

-   Bronchospasm post-op especially in asthmatic or COPD patients

-   Pulmomnary edema

    -   Fluid overload - in heart failure patients having pulmonary edema

    -   Negative pressure pulmonary edema - patient breath against airway obstruction, generate large negative intrathoraxix pressure that pulls fluid into the lung parenchyma; heart on x-ray is not large, unlike the cardiogenic edema; treat with c-pap or bipap; failing which, will need intubation.

-   Aspiration - right lower lobe; right bronchus is straighter, aspirates tend to go there.

### Hypercarbia

PaCO2 is above 55.

-   Opioid medication - deep slow breathing; patient is very comfortable and drowsy

    -   IV naloxone; comes in 0.4 mg 1 ml vial;

    -   Don't give it neat, dilute it to 10 mls and give 1 ml at a time and titrate to response

    -   If given the entire vial, will trigger opioid withdrawal including sympathetic surge causing pulmonary edema and also cause the patient to be in a lot of pain.

-   Muscle relaxation inadequate reverse - shallow fast breathing; patient feel like they are suffocating and becomes agitated, may have twitchy movements.

-   Volatile anesthetics e.g. sevoflurane, desflurane, - shallow rapid breathing; raise the threshold for CO2, patient will not breath until the CO2 is higher; just let patient

-   Brain stem injury

-   High dead space

-   Malignant hyperthermia - triggered by succinylcholine and inhaled anesthetics; Uncoupling of calcium metabolism in mitochondria from a rare (1:15,000) genetic defect in the ryanodine receptor of the calcium channel; give dantrolene

-   Fever or sepsis,

-   Shivering

-   MH

-   Thyrotoxicosis

-   Overfeeding with total parenteral nutrition

-   CO2 insufflation

-   Bicarbonate administration

-   CO2 rebreathing

Over production of CO2 or reduced removal

### Hemodynamic Instability

#### Hypertension

INcrease of 20% over baseline preop value for 15 min (50% for single measurement) or SBP \> 180 mmHg or DBP \> 110 mmHg. Causes

-   Exclude the danger causes first: hypoxemia and hypercarbia, Cushing's reflex related to ICP

-   Distended bladder

-   Post-op nausea vomit

-   Pre-existing hypertension - missed meds prior to or during surg

-   Endocrine causes - pheochromocytoma (undiagnosed), Cushing's syndrome

-   Pain

Don's treat for 10 - 15 minutes first.

#### Hypotension

Decrease of 20% over baseline preop value for 15 min (50% for single measurement) or SBP \> 180 mmHg or DBP \> 110 mmHg. Causes

-   Preload: Venous pooling, Cardiac tamponade, Tension pneumothorax

-   Cardiac causes: MI , fluid overload, dysrhythmias, valvular patho, tamponade

-   Afterload: sepsis, anaphylaxis, neuraxail blackage, vasodilators

### PONV

30 - 35% patients have PONV;

-   Aspiration

-   Hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis

### Delayed Emergence

Delayed emergence is defined as the failure to regain consciousness 30-60 minutes after general anesthesia, and the clinical presentation often involves both altered mental status and respiratory complications.

Causes of delayed emergence - reduced consciousness

-   Metabolic derangement: hyponatremia coma (TURP - large volume of glycine is the past), blood glucose level determine quickly with hypocount

-   Endocrine disorder: hypothyroidism

-   hypoxia and hypercarbia - check vitals first

-   Neurological consult / CT for stroke

-   Alcohol intoxication and sleep

-   Drug sensitivity - liver and renal functions

Treatment

-   flumazenil for benz

-   Sodium - give slowly due to central pontine myelinolysis

### Post-op Delirium

Debilitating, can be days to months.

Risks and causes

-   and not being able to move around

Management: Do not sedate immediately

-   Check vitals, make sure not hypoxemia and hypercarbia

-   Haloperidol can be administered orally, intramuscularly, and intravenously. An initial dose of 1 to 2 mg of haloperidol is recommended with doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg every 4 hours for maintenance dosing in elderly patients

-   Clinical features of shock

    -   Oliguria

    -   hypotension

    -   altered mental status

    -   Tachypnea, Kussmaul's breathing (compensate metabolic acidosis from lactosis)

    -   Cold extremities, narrow pulse pressures, tachycardia

-   Final common pathyway leading to cardiac arrest

    -   Reduced conscious leve - upper airway obstruction, hypoventilation, pulmonary aspiration, reduced sympathetic outflow; note that hypoventilation and upper airway obstrction result in respiratory acidosis that contribute to metabolic acidosis; reduced sympathetic outflow

    -   Respiratory failure - hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and respiratory acidosio, tachypnoea and icnreased work of breathing

    -   Circulatory failure - hypotension, tachycardia, secondary myocardial dysfunction, arrhythmia, metabolic acidosis, Kussmaul's breathing, AKI

    There is a National Early Warning Score: RR, O2 sat, Supplicmental oxy, temp, sbp, HR, level of consciousness; everything can happen in both directions. In early and later stages are different.

    -   Looks normal - assess clinical preload

    -   Looks small - tamponade

    -   Left big - LVF

    -   Right big left small - RVF ; don't give too much fluid

    -   Balloon up - congestive heart failure

    -   Peripheral venous collapse sign (dyanmic tests) - put hand on chest- is the venous system full?

-   Cases

    -   Bleeding person with severe shock - 500 ml of Hartmann solution

    -   Pulse Oxi says low but no cyanose (sign of hypoxia) - check the pulse ox; person in shock may not have a great reading

    -   Circulation volume is 70 ml/kg - 70 \* 50 kg = 3.5 litres; 2L is 75% of 3.5L final Hb is 57/100 \* 6.7; If severe hemodilution happens, give O negative blood and activate mass hemorrage protocol

    -   After receiving 4 unit of packed red blood cells, patient because oliguric, ams, poor SpO2, hypoventilation; this is the final pathway to cardiac arrest - patient in acute heart failure; assess ABC and start resuscitation before cardiac arrest.

            -   NGAMA - HARDASS - hyperchloremia from normal saline ()

        -   Hyponatremia need to give saline (differentiate based on circulating volume) and gastric outlet obstruction loss hydrochloric acid

        -   Differentiate low sodium

            -   Dilution - with circulatory volume overload, SIADH (uremia plasma, sodium osmolilty)

            -   Sodium wasting - diuretics (thiazide)

        -   Sodium management, both hyper and hypo are important. Intravascular volume status is important.

        -   Anasarca - is general swelling of the whole body that can occur when the tissues of the body retain too much fluid. Right heart failure or elevated CVP; or low albumin or inflammatory causes.

Complications of Anesthesia
---------------------------

### Malignant Hyperthermia

A rare but life-threatening condition likely due to a skeletal muscle receptor anomaly that results in excessive intracellular calcium accumulation upon exposure to volatile anesthetics, succinylcholine, and/or excessive heat.

-   Clinical Features

    -   Sudden onset masseter muscle / generalized rigidity

    -   Resultant hypermetabolism leads to rhabdomyolysis, sinus tachycardia, hypercarbia resistant to increased minute ventilation, hyperkalemia, and hyperthermia (late manifestation)

-   Treatment

    -   Respiratory / ventilation support

    -   Immediate cessation of causative anesthetic

    -   Dantrolene - a skeletal muscle relaxant

Pediatrics Anesthesia
---------------------

Don't think of children as little adults. They have different anatomy, physiology, psychology etc.

### Aiway manageemnt

-   Large head

-   Large tongue

-   Prominent adenoids and tonsils

Implications:

-   Head tilt, chin lift in younger vs jaw thrust in older children

-   Check that the appropirate sized airway tool need to be present

### Intubation

-   Large head

-   Anterior and cephalad larynx

-   Long narrow epiglottis

-   Short neck and trachea

-   Pediatric airway is cone shaped (narrowest part in the cricoid cartilage in children less than 7 year old) but the adult airway is cylindrical shaped (narrowest part in the vocal cord).

Implications

-   No need for pillow under head in young child to align the orophargyngeal and larygngeal mask

-   Oropharyngeal-largyngeal axis

-
