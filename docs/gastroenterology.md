# Gastroenterology

Upper GI
--------

Upper GI ends at **ligament of Treitz**.

![gastro-ligament-treiz](figures/gastro-ligament-treiz.jpg)

### Achalasia

Achalasia occurs due to degeneration of neurons within the myenteric plexus. Patients typically present with the gradual onset of solid and liquid dysphagia due to uncoordinated peristalsis and failed relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Esophageal manometry typically shows high LES resting pressure.

### Esophageal Rupture

### Esophageal Varices

Management

- Do not insert a nasogastric tube as it may worsen the bleeding!
- Start **IV somatostatin 250 mcg** bolus, followed by an IV infusion of 250 mcg/hr (successful in up to 85-90% of cases). 
- If somatostatin is unsuccessful in stopping the bleeding, and there is the risk of the patient exsanguinating before endoscopy can be arranged, then the insertion of a **Sengstaken-Blakemore tube** should be considered. This should be inserted *only by* an experienced operator.
- Administer IV **antibiotic prophylaxis** with **ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin** to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
- TIPPS
  - TIPPS in singapore is IR guided and thus while early TIPSS definition is within 48 hours, there are logistical limitations
  - Use temporising treatments like SB and Dannis stents in the interim
- DO NOT USE APC for managing varices - too deep. Bleeding will become more intense. 

### Esophagitis



### Gastritis

Inflammatory forms of gastritis may be caused by chronic infections, such as H. pylori, or acute infections, such as enterovirus.Non-inflammatory forms of \"gastritis\" are histologically termed gastropathy. These may be caused by chemical irritants to the stomach, including alcohol and medications.

-   Presentation

    -   Inflammation or irritation of the stomach lining often causing sharp epigastric pain.

    -   This pain may be variably worsened or improved with eating food.

    -   Patients with inflammation of the stomach may have nausea and decreased appetite.

    -   exaggerated by stress/emotions, diet, medications (particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and other things that cause excess acid production such as spicy food.

    -   The bowels are usually not affected unless there is a component of irritable bowel syndrome and stress. In that case there may be either decreased or increased stooling.

### GERD 胃灼热,胃酸倒流

GERD is a chronic relapsing condition in which gastric contents reflux through the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) into the esophagus and oropharynx. Transient LES relaxations are believed to be the primary etiologic factor. Ineffective esophageal clearance (as seen with scleroderma, for example) and delayed gastric emptying (as seen with gastroparesis, for example) may also be contributing factors in some patients. Increased intra-abdominal pressure is also a predisposing factor (obesity/central adiposity, pregnancy, constricting garments), especially in the presence of hiatal hernia.

-   Classic symptoms of retrosternal heartburn and regurgitation, which worsen when

    -   gastric volume is increased (after large meals)

    -   gastric contents are located near the gastroesophageal junction (reclining or bending)

    -   intra-abdominal pressure is increased (such as with obesity, pregnancy, abdominal binders, or girdles).

-   May be associated with regurgitation and, rarely, dysphagia due to esophgeal spasm

-   Nausea, vomiting, hematochezia, and melena are not typically associated with GERD. Hematemesis in the setting of GERD-like symptoms is unusual and represents an alarm symptom indicative of an upper GI bleed warranting prompt GI referral for evaluation and upper endoscopy.

-   Precipitate by

    -   Spicy, acidic, and fatty foods; Chocolate, Mint

    -   Smoking, Alcohol and caffeine

    -   Eating large portions and Lying flat after a meal

    -   Wearing tight clothing around the waist

    -   Some medications (calcium channel blockers, beta-agonists, alpha-adrenergic agonists, theophylline, nitrates, and some sedatives)

-   Atypical signs and symptoms of GERD:

    -   Asthma, especially new onset in an adult with no history of atopy

    -   Chronic cough

    -   Dental enamel loss

    -   Globus sensation

    -   Hoarseness

    -   Noncardiac chest pain

    -   Recurrent laryngitis

    -   Recurrent pharyngitis

    -   Subglottic stenosis

-   Complications\

    -   Poor Quality of Life\
        Patients who have GERD generally report decreased quality of life, reduced productivity, and decreased well-being. In many patients, reported health-related quality of life is lower than age-matched patients who have untreated angina pectoris, diabetes mellitus or chronic heart failure.

    -   Esophagitis - develops when the mucosal defenses that normally counteract the effect of injurious agents are overwhelmed by refluxed acid, pepsin, or bile.

    -   Peptic strictures - from fibrosis and constriction occur in about 10 percent of patients with reflux esophagitis.

    -   Barrett's esophagus - Replacement of the squamous epithelium of the esophagus by columnar epithelium

    -   Adenocarinoma - 2-5% of Barrett's esophagus

### Peptic Ulcer Disease 溃疡 

Associated with H pylori infection (75 - 95% of the duodenal ulcers, and 65 - 95% of gastric ulcers), although most patients do not know their H. Pylori status. In addition, many patients with ulcer disease and serology findings negative for H. Pylori report recent use of NSAIDs. 

-   Presentation

    -   Concurrent, episodic gnawing or burning pain; pain relieved by food; and nighttime awakening with pain. 
    -   **Epigastric abdominal pain that improves with meals is the hallmark of PUD**. However, in some cases, symptoms of PUD may worsen with meals. For example, gastric ulcer pain may occur 5 to 15 minutes after eating and remain until the stomach empties, which may be up to several hours in duration; the pain may otherwise be absent during times of fasting. Pain from **duodenal ulcers is often relieved by eating**, drinking milk, or taking antacids but may return anywhere from 90 minutes to four hours after eating a meal. Both gastric and duodenal ulcers may be associated with nausea and vomiting occurring anytime shortly after eating to several hours later.

    -   Hematemesis, if present, suggests more complicated disease, such as bleeding ulcer, and warrants urgent GI referral and endoscopy. Melena commonly occurs in the setting of an upper GI bleed secondary to PUD or hemorrhagic gastritis (e.g., NSAID-gastritis). Hematochezia only occurs in the setting of an upper GI bleed when massive (e.g., variceal rupture).
-   Risk Factors

    -   Aspirin and other **nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs** (NSAIDs) are the predominant pharmacologic agents that contribute to the development of PUD. Classically, older adults are at the highest attributable risk of ulceration and perforation due to chronic NSAID use. Chronic NSAID use is a leading cause of morbidity in older adults.

    -   There is no evidence to support a cause-and-effect association between cigarette smoking and PUD. However, cigarette smoking does decrease vascularity to gastric mucosal cells, resulting in decreased rates of mucosal healing after injury, and, in combination with NSAID use or H. pylori infection, increases the risk of ulceration.

    -   Colonization of the stomach by H. pylori renders the underlying mucosa more vulnerable to peptic acid damage by disrupting the mucous layer, liberating enzymes and toxins, and adhering to the gastric epithelium. In addition, the body's immune response to H. pylori incites an inflammatory reaction that contributes to tissue injury and leads to chronic gastritis. In most individuals the chronic gastritis is asymptomatic and does not progress. In some cases, however, altered gastric secretion coupled with tissue injury leads to peptic ulcer disease. In other cases, gastritis progresses to mucosal atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and eventually gastric carcinoma. Rarely, persistent immune stimulation of gastric lymphoid tissue can lead to gastric lymphoma.

    -   Moderate to severe physiologic stress may lead to stress ulceration, predominantly in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).
-   Physical
    -   Oral mucosa hydration
    -   Abdominal examination: tenderness? organomegaly
    -   DRE for Fecal Occult Blood
-   Investigation
    -   Raised urea may indicate GI bleed
        -   But must be interpreted with creatinine
        -   Worsening of renal function
        -   Patient with Gout and worsening of renal function

-   Diagnosis: withhold PPI and histamine then conduct Urea Breath Test

    -   Recommend withholding PPI for 7 -- 14 days before UBT; mechanism of increasing false-negative by UBT is poorly defined though hypothesis is pH dependent suppression of H pylori activity; by extrapolation, the use of histamine would also increase the likelihood of UBT false negative result since histamine increases intracellular cAMP which increases secretion of gastric juice

-   Management

    -   Trial of PPI

    -   If fails PPI test for H. pylori

        -   The H. pylori IgG serologic test only confirms evidence of past infection and an immunologic response to H. pylori . In a population with a high prevalence of active H. pylori infection, it is a useful first-time test. However, if the population prevalence of active infection is low, then the test may yield a high number of false-positive results. It should not be used to confirm eradication of H. pylori after treatment as it can remain positive for years.

        -   The urea breath test accurately detects active infection but is more expensive than serologic testing. It is less accurate during PPI therapy, and patients would need to stop the PPI for at least two weeks before a urea breath test (bismuth and antibiotics should also be stopped for at least two weeks before a urea breath test.). However, urea breath testing may be appropriate depending on the characteristics of the population being tested.

        -   The stool antigen test for H. pylori is also accurate and widely available, but it is more expensive and less convenient than serologic testing. The stool antigen and urease breath tests may also be used as confirmatory tests after a positive serologic test.

        -   If alarming symptoms develop or if patient is on PPI, antibiotics, or bismuth, perform endoscopoc testing for H. pylori

        If H. pylori infection confirmed,

        -   Triple therapy for 10 - 14 days (70 - 85% eradication rate): PPI dose bid, amoxicillin 1 g bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid

        -   Quadruple therapy for 10 - 14 days (75 - 90% eradication rate): PPI once or twice daily, metronidazole 250 mg 4x/day, tetracycline 500 mg 4x/day, biosmuth subsalicylate 525 mg 4x/day

        -   For patients with penicillin allergy: PPI bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid, metronidazole 500 mg bid

    -   If H. pylori is not present

        -   Tricyclic antidepressants have been found to improve symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia without affecting the sensation of gastric distention.

        -   Prokinetics have been found to improve symptoms of functional dyspepsia, specifically early satiety and bloating, though the evidence supporting this is of low-quality.

        -   A systematic review determined that there is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of psychological therapies---including cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy, relaxation training and interpersonal therapy---for the treatment of functional dyspepsia. However, individual trials have reported some modest clinical benefits in symptomatic improvement.

        -   Alternative therapies are gaining popularity in patients with gastrointestinal conditions, and studies of varying quality suggest that slippery elm, capsaicin, peppermint oil, caraway oil, and artichoke leaf may improve symptoms in some patients. However, there is as yet no compelling evidence on which to base a recommendation for these alternative therapies. Note: Peppermint oil decreases lower esophageal sphincter pressure and may worsen GERD symptoms. Patients should be educated that herbal remedies are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), may not have been studied for safety, and can have adverse side effects, which very often include GI side effects.

    -   Rule out GI bleeding

        -   If symptoms have not improved, it is reasonable to consider fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) to rule out occult bleeding.

        -   Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) is more sensitive and specific than FOBT for detecting occult lower GI bleeding; however, it is not suitable for detecting gastric bleeding, and it should not be used if the suspected source of bleeding is proximal to the ligament of Treitz.

        -   The guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (FOBT), such as Hemoccult II SENSA, are best used to check for occult upper GI bleeding.

        -   Multiple negative FOBTs or FITs do not exclude the presence of either upper or lower GI blood loss. Diets high in red meat, iron, and vitamin C may cause false positive results with guaiac-based tests.

        In patients who with a positive FOBT, it is important to obtain a CBC to assess the degree of blood loss and to determine the urgency of GI referral.

    -   If patient fails initial triple or quadruple therapy, perform fecal antigen test and urea breath test are reasonable next steps to evaluate eradication of H. pylori.

        -   The fecal antigen test involves collection of a stool sample the size of an acorn by either the clinician or the patient; the sample is then analyzed in a laboratory by trained personnel.

        -   The urea breath test requires specialized equipment and patient preparation.

        Both tests have been reported to have a sensitivity and specificity for active H. pylori infection of \> 90%. The H. pylori fecal antigen test is less expensive and may be more cost-effective than the urease breath test.

        If the fecal antigen test or the urea breath test is positive, the patient will require re-treatment for a resistant infection with levofloxacin triple therapy, but this should not be given prior to testing for the presence of active H. pylori infection. If the fecal antigen test or urea breath test is negative, and the patient continues to have symptoms, he should be referred to a gastroenterologist for an upper endoscopy/EGD and mucosal biopsy.

        Testing for H. Pylori eradication is also useful in patients with H. pylori-associated MALT lymphoma, history of resection for early gastric cancer, and patients planning to resume chronic NSAID therapy.

## Bowel Conditions

### Hernia

#### Inguinal Hernia

An inguinal hernia is a painless swelling in the inguinal region, which can be enhanced by maneuvers that raise intra-abdominal pressure, such as cough or Valsalva maneuver. The swelling becomes painful and tender when it is incarcerated.

Indirect hernia: An indirect inguinal hernia develops as a result of a persistent process vaginalis. The inguinal canal begins in the intra-abdominal cavity at the internal inguinal ring, located approximately midway between the pubic symphysis and the anterior iliac spine. The canal courses down along the inguinal ligament to the external ring, located medial to the inferior epigastric arteries, subcutaneously and slightly above the pubic tubercle. Contents of this hernia then follow the tract of the testicle down into the scrotal sac.

Direct hernia: A direct inguinal hernia usually occurs due to a defect or weakness in the transversalis fascia area of the Hesselbach triangle. The triangle is defined inferiorly by the inguinal ligament, laterally by the inferior epigastric arteries, and medially by the conjoint tendon.

### Intestinal Obstruction

Constipation has the highest positive predictive value.

### Paralytic Ileus



### Appendicitis 盲肠炎

Location of the pain has a very strong and highest predictive value. 

All patients with RLQ tenderness should be diagnosed as having appendicitis until proven otherwise. Special groups of patients to be particularly vigilant include children, the elderly, women, pregnant women and the immunocompromised.

**Clinical Features**

- The **classical presentation** of pain beginning periumbilically and **moving** to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) associated with vomiting, anorexia, rebound, and fever are reported in only 50-60% of patients.
  - Body temperatures >39°C are uncommon in the first 24 hours of illness but not uncommon - after the rupture of the appendix. Think of other diagnosis (e.g. acute pyelonephritis, PID) in a patient with a high fever (>39°C) early in the onset of abdominal pain.
  - Patients with acute appendicitis will frequently give a history of having had some vomiting. They generally have nausea, loss of appetite, mild fever, and will usually have decreased stooling or constipation.
- **Atypical/early presentations** are actually more common. Early pain may be vaguely localized to the epigastrium which makes diagnosis difficult. Retrocaecal appendix, due to its 'hidden' position, is thought to result in delayed diagnosis of acute appendicitis and increased rate of perforation.
- **Right lower quadrant pain** (80%) and **pain before vomiting** (100%) are more consistent for appendicitis compared with fever (67%) and nausea (58%). 
  - Vomiting following the onset of abdominal pain is more consistent with appendicitis than other diagnosis. 

**Physical Examination**

- Obturator sign
- Psoas Sign

**Investigation**

- Leucocycosis with 'left shift' is seen in 75-80% of patients with acute appendicitis.
   these values alone have been shown not to be useful in ruling out appendicitis because of its low sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and lack of discriminative powers.
- Urinalysis should also be interpreted with caution in view of the close proximity of the appendix to the ureter; appendiceal inflammation may result in changes in urine sediment resulting in the false diagnosis of urinary tract infection.
- The only finding specific for appendicitis on abdominal X-ray is the faecolith but this is rarely seen on plain films (2% incidence) and does not justify the cost of obtaining the study.

**Diagnosis**

- **No** laboratory test can establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis with 100% accuracy. Serial clinical examination is the key to diagnosis.

  - **Ultrasonography** has been used successfully in diagnosing acute appendicitis, although the greatest experience has been in children. In adults, sensitivity and specificity are approximately 86 and 81%, respectively and is frequently insufficient or non-diagnostic.
    - Can still be done to role out differentials
    - Free fluid
  - CT is far superior to ultrasound, and may be particularly useful in females to reduce negative appendectomy rate. It is also useful in patients with atypical presentation, e.g. RIF pain with fever and diarrhoea (colitis) and elderly patients with malignancy
    - System based investigation
    - CT is only done in SGH if it will change practice, unlike in the States, everyone gets CT

  | Modality | Sensitivity (Sn) | Specificity (Sp) | +ve LR | -ve LR |
  | -------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------ |
  | U/S      | 86               | 81               | 5.8    | 0.19   |
  | CT       | 94               | 95               | 13.3   | 0.09   |

- The benefit of **diagnostic laparoscopy** has been the most evidence in fertile women, in whom it is associated with an 80% reduction in the rate of negative appendectomies

- Use the **Alvarado Score** to predict the likelihood of Appendicitis (need leukocyte values).

**Management**

- High Clinical Suspicion
  - The diagnosis begins with a history and physical examination (including pelvic and rectal).
  - Withhold foods and fluids from the patient, i.e. nil by mouth.
  - Set up intravenous (IV) lines and send blood for **full blood count, urea/electrolytes/ creatinine**.
  - Perform a urinalysis.
  - Conduct a urine pregnancy test, if applicable.
  - Give titrated IV analgesia
    - opiates together with an anti-emetic can be safely administered as they improve symptoms but do not mask the signs of peritonism.
  - Obtain surgical consultation.
  - Give IV **ceftriaxone** 1 g and IV **metronidazole** 500 mg if there are signs of appendiceal perforation
  - Admit to General Surgery for appendectomy.
- Borderline cases
  - History and physical examination (including pelvic and rectal).
  - Full blood count.
  - Urinalysis.
  - Urine pregnancy test, if applicable.
  - Send the patient to the **observation** unit for serial clinical examination and **Alvarado scoring.**
    - *As* appendicitis is an evolving illness, the clinical picture will become clearer during observation. With additional time, the observation unit allows the physician to evaluate patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain better.
    - The **Alvarado score** is based on three symptoms, three signs, and two laboratory findings. A score of 5 or 6 is compatible with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis (continue observation). A score of 7 or 8 indicates a probable appendicitis, and a score of 9 or 10 indicates a very probable acute appendicitis (admit patient). &leq;4 discharge patients.
      - Migrating to the right iliac fossa, Anorexia, N/V, Tenderness in the right iliac fossa, Rebound pain, Elevated temperature (fever), Leucocytosis, Shift of leucocytes to the left

### Meckel's diverticulitis

### Diverticulitis

-   Presentation

    -   Classically presents with acute left lower quadrant abdominal pain, change in bowel movements, and fever.

    -   Most common in patients over 50 years of age.

### Inflammatory Bowel Syndrome 炎性肠道疾病

Inflammatory bowel disease can often be misdiagnosed as a gynecologic problem since constipation and diarrhea are associated with premenstrual syndrome as well. Additionally, when a person has bloody stools during her menses, the clinical diagnosis can be more confusing. However, when there is pain with defecation and bloody stools occur at times other than during menses this diagnosis becomes clearer. Abnormal vaginal bleeding is not a typical symptom of inflammatory bowel disease.

#### Ulcerative Colitis

#### Crohn's Disease

### Irritable Bowel Disease

IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) typically causes a variety of symptoms which can include abdominal pain, loose stools, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating, increased flatulence and mucus in stools. IBS is generally a diagnosis of exclusion. Symptoms of IBS can be brought on initially by a case of gastroenteritis and can be aggravated by stress, anxiety, and depression, dietary changes or change in activity, and are often unpredictable.

-   Presentation

    -   crampy pain prior to and during menses, but will also occur at other times during the month.

    -   This pain is often associated with diarrhea and/or constipation.

-   Diagnosis: Rome Criteria

    -   Recurrent abdominal pain, on average day per week in past three months with of following features:

        -   related to defecation;

        -   associated with change in stool frequency;

        -   associated with change in stool form (appearance)

        Lab studies are NOT required if other diagnoses are unlikely.

-   Treatment

    -   Offering behavioral therapies and exercise

### Adenitis

## Pancreatic Conditions

### Acute Pancreatitis 急性胰腺炎

**Causes**

- Autoimmune causes
- Alcohol
- Trauma
- Metabolic causes
- Neoplastic causes

**Clinical Features**

-   Presentation

    -   Causes severe abdominal pain, associated with nausea and vomiting

    -   Pain is typically located in the epigastric area with radiation to the back, improves with leaning forward, and worsens with eating. Symptoms often last for many hours without relief, and is unlikely to resolve with bowel rest.

    -   Acute and chronic pancreatitis are most commonly caused by alcohol use and gallstones. Remember that some patients may not be forthcoming about their actual alcohol use, especially if they perceive they are being judged or if they are in denial about problem use/abuse.

    -   May present with shock and coma!

-   Physical

    -   Ill appearance on exam, and clinical signs of dehydration such as tachycardia, jaundice may be seen if there is obstruction of the common bile duct.

    -   Signs of necrotising pancreatitis

        -   Grey Turner Sign: Ecchymotic discoloration in the flank
        -   Cullen sign: Ecchymptoc discoloration in the periumbilical region

#### Complications

1. **Portal Hypertension** - Ascites +/- spontaneous bacterial peritonitis

   - What we would send ascites for

2. **Variceal Bleeding**

3. **Hepatic Encephalopathy**

   - Differential of AMS even if there is cirrhosis

- US abdomen +/- Doppler
- OGD

#### Management

- Liver transplant is the only definitive treatment.

**Treatment for Cirrhosis Complications**

![Screenshot 2020-06-25 at 12.00.33](figures/Screenshot%202020-06-25%20at%2012.00.33.png)

- Oesophageal varices
  - EVL
  - NSBB
  - Regular surveillance of progression of varices

- Ascites
  - Low salt diet
  - Diuretics (spironolactone, furosemide)
  - Large volume paracentesis in diuretic refractory and diuretic intolerant
  - TIPPS
- Hepatic Encephalopahty
  - Lactulose
    - Very special, not just flushing the gut like other diuretics
    - ![Screenshot 2020-06-25 at 12.04.43](figures/Screenshot%202020-06-25%20at%2012.04.43.png)
    - Ammonia is processed in the liver in urea cycle into urea, which when disrupted, ammonia 
    - Lactulose is a probiotic, polysaccharide, not absorbed, processed into short chain fatty acids by the gut bacteria that is not only hyper-osmotic but also 
  - Rifaximin: antibiotic used to treat traveler's diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy

#### Hepatorenal syndrome

- Always in a pre-renal failure state due to chronic vasodilation, and splenic dilation, portal system shunting of blood; on top of ascites and third spacing; Therefore kidneys have pre-renal failure, due to low flow kicked into full failure by infections, 
- Treatment is vasoconstriction

#### Hepatopulmonary syndrome

- Shunt formation in the lung
- Due to angiogenesis (body trying to by pass a shunt), lungs have a lot of AVM shunts everywhere
- The patients will become hypoxic

### Budd-Chiari Syndrome

**Budd**–**Chiari syndrome** is a very rare condition, affecting one in a million adults. The condition is caused by occlusion of the hepatic veins that drain the liver. It presents with the classical triad of abdominal pain, ascites, and liver enlargement.

### Liver Cancer

#### Liver Metastasis



### Liver Transplant

#### Complications

**Hyperacute rejection**

A relatively rare form of rejection due to an antibody/complement-mediated response (eg, ABO mismatch). This outcome manifests <1 week after transplantation.

**Infections**

Infections continue to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who have undergone liver transplantation. **Length of time since transplant** helps categorize the likely infectious organism as follows:

- **<1 month:** **Bacterial** causes from operative complications (eg, hepatic abscess, biliary leak, wound infection) or hospitalization (eg, intravascular catheter, external drain)
- **Months 1-6**: **Opportunistic** pathogens (eg, *Cytomegalovirus, Aspergillus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis*) in the setting of high-dose immunosuppressive medication
- **>6 months**: **Immunosuppressants** usually at maintenance levels. Patients primarily at risk for typical community-acquired pathogens (at a higher rate than the general population)

**Acute cellular rejection**

Occurs <90 days after transplantation and can cause fever, right upper quadrant pain, and elevations in liver function tests. 

**Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease**

Usually due to Epstein-Barr virus in the setting of chronic high-dose immunosuppression. Fever, weight loss, and fatigue are common presenting symptoms. This patient with significant leukocytosis and rapid-onset symptoms 2 weeks post transplantation likely has a bacterial infection.



### Acute Liver Failure



### Acute Hepatic Encephalopathy

Hepatic encephalopathy is defined as a syndrome of altered mental state and **reversible** neuropsychiatric state complicating liver disease.

There are two classifications each with widely differing aetiologies, clinical presentations, physical findings, and management principles:

- Encephalopathy associated with **acute liver failure**.
- Encephalopathy associated with **liver cirrhosis** and **portal hypertension**.

Tips

- Be aware that not all hepatic encephalopathies arise in patients with chronic liver cirrhosis. Acute hepatic failure can arise from ingestion of toxins, recreational drug use, and hepatitis A, B, and E.
- Avoid narcotics, tranquillizers, and sedatives that are metabolized in the liver.

#### **Encephalopathy** *associated with acute* liver failure

- A medical emergency that requires prompt recognition and treatment as the patient may deteriorate into a coma and require a liver transplant.
- Typically the patient is previously well with **no history of liver disease.**

- Symptoms are vague and non-specific, i.e. malaise and fatigue with nausea, followed by jaundice and encephalopathy that may progress rapidly to coma.

**Clinical Features**

- History
  - Overdose of **paracetamol.**
  - Ingestion of toxins such as **fenfluramin**.
  - Use of the recreational drugs cocaine and Ecstasy / Intravenous (IV) drug use.
  - A recent **travel history** in an attempt to exclude hepatitis A and E.
  - A history of recent **sexual exposure** significant for possible hepatitis B.
- Physical
  - Should show NO signs of chronic liver disease, focal neurology or a high fever. Such findings should prompt the search for an alternative cause for encephalopathy.

**Diagnosis**

- Grades of encephalopathy

  | Grade | Remark                                                       |
  | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | I     | Trivial lack of awareness, anxiety, euphoria, or short attention span |
  | II    | Lethargy or apathy with minimal disorientation for time or place. The patient may should subtle personality change or inappropriate behaviour |
  | III   | Stupor and confusion                                         |
  | IV    | Coma                                                         |

**Management**

- Preparation
  - The **patient** should be managed in the critical care area of the emergency department.
  - Airway maintenance and oxygenation: If the patient is comatose or has airway compromise, perform endotracheal intubation.
  - Establish peripheral IV line.
    - Administer IV fluids: Normal saline infusion at a rate sufficient to maintain peripheral perfusion is best performed with haemodynamic monitoring.
    - Give **IV mannitol 20%, 1g/kg** body weight

- Investigation
  - Bedside: ECG, Vital signs q5 to 15 minutes and pulse oximetry.
  - Bloods
    - Stat capillary blood sugar
    - Full blood count (purple), coagulation profile (blue)
    - Liver function tests, urea/electrolytes/creatinine (yellow)
    - Serum toxicology (where relevant)
    - Hepatitis A,B,C,D, and E (anti-HAV IgM, HbsAg, anti-HBS, anti-HCV, anti-delta, and anti-HBE) screening
  - Imaging: Urgent head computed tomography scan to detect cerebral oedema
- Team formation
  - Consult Gastroenterology and admit to ICU

####  Encephalopathy associated with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension

- The patient **has established liver disease** and has a disturbance of consciousness that develops over a short period of time and fluctuates in severity, or may be a more chronic phenomenon.
- The current classification consists of 3 categories: **Episodic, persistent, or minimal**. Encephalopathy in cirrhosis is caused by portosystemic shunting and altered amino acid metabolism with ammonia playing a strong role as well as other neurotransmitters.

**Clinical Feature**

- The recognition of a history of established cirrhosis or liver disease is important.
- Identify the precipitating event
  - **H** Haemorrhage from the gastrointestinal tract, e.g. from varices or erosions.
  - **E** Electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, alkalosis as seen in diuretic use, and vomiting and diarrhoea) and hypoglycaemia.
  - **P** Protein intake (excessive).
  - **A** Azotaemia (from volume contraction) and diuretics.
  - **T** Tranquillizers and other sedatives.
  - **I** Infections, e.g. spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, urinary tract infection or pneumonia, and also infections arising in surgical wounds.
  - **C** Constipation.
- Physical Exam
  - May show signs of chronic liver disease, e.g. spider naevi, gynaecomastia, liver palms, leuchonychia, and a hepatic flap.
  - May show enlargement of the liver or spleen as well as ascites.
  - Should include a rectal examination for melaena (black tar-like stool).

**Management**

- Preparation

  - Manage the patient in the **critical care area** of the emergency department.
  - Airway maintenance and oxygenation: If the patient is comatose or has airway compromise, perform endotracheal intubation.
  - Monitoring: Electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs q5 to 15 minutes, and pulse oximetry.
  - Establish peripheral IV line.
  - Administer IV fluids: Normal saline infusion at a rate sufficient to maintain peripheral perfusion is best performed with haemodynamic monitoring.

- Investigate

  These are targeted to confirm the **diagnosis of encephalopathy** complicating cirrhosis as well as to look for the **precipitating cause:**

  - Stat capillary blood sugar.
  - Full blood count, coagulation profile
  - urea/electrolytes/creatinine, ammonia, and liver function tests.
  - Blood cultures and urinalysis as indicated.
  - Chest X-ray.

- Initial Drug Therapy

  - **IV dextrose 50% 40 ml** for hypoglycaemia and **IV thiamine 100 mg** if the patient has alcoholic cirrhosis.
  - **IV naloxone 2 mg** if the patient has significant obtundation.
  - **IV flumazenil 0.5 mg** repeated after 5 minutes (shown in small controlled trials to improve the grade of encephalopathy).

- Reversal of encephalopathy

  - **Lactulose 30 ml** given orally (PO) or a lactulose enema: Produces an osmotic diarrhoea, thus altering intestinal flora that decreases ammonia production.
  - **Oral antibiotics:** Randomized controlled trials show no clinical benefits.
  - **Protection of gastrointestinal mucosa:** Give **omeprazole 20--40 mg IV** slowly over 5 minutes.

- Team formation

  - Consult Gastroenterology with a view co-admit to a high dependency unit (or intensive care unit if incubated).

### Cholelithiasis 胆石 

Symptoms are a result of a stimulated gallbladder (e.g., from a fatty meal) contracting when a gallstone obstructs the outlet of the cystic duct. 

Presentation

- Biliary colic typically causes right upper quadrant pain, epigastric pain or chest pain that is constant (the term \"colic\" is a misnomer), typically lasts 4-6 hours or less, and often radiates to the back (classically under the right shoulder blade). 
- It is often accompanied by nausea or vomiting and often follows a heavy, fatty meal. 
- The hallmark of biliary colic is that the stone is mobile and eventually moves away from the outlet allowing resumption of normal gallbladder function and resolution of symptoms.

### Cholecystitis

The pathophysiology of cholecystitis is similar to biliary colic but is caused by a stone that is not dislodged from the cystic duct outlet. 

**Clinical Features**

- RUQ pain from cholecystitis also causes right upper quadrant pain with associated nausea and vomiting and also classically occurs following a large, fatty meal. 
- In contrast to biliary colic, the symptoms of cholecystitis typically persist, are more severe, and are often associated with fever. An elevated white blood cell count is often present from inflammation of the distended gallbladder wall. It should be noted that these inflammatory changes found with cholecystitis can be acute or chronic. 
- Less than 25% of patients with Acute Cholecystitis present without right upper quadrant pain or colic

-   Physical

    -   Positive Murphy's sign - high specificity, low sensitivity

#### Acalculous Cholecystitis

A cholecystitis in which gallstones are not implicated in the pathophysiology, can occur, particularly in the elderly and the very-ill ICU patient.

### Cholangitis

#### Acute Cholangitis

- Charcot's Triad: fever, upper abdominal pain, jaundice
- Rayneud's Pentad: Charcot's triad + HoTN + syncope

**Management**

- Blood culture
- ERCP

**Case**

- Patient worsen after ERCP

  - HAGMA found in renal panel
    - Lactate and ketones
      - DKA delayed presentation
