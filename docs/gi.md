### Gastritis

Inflammatory forms of gastritis may be caused by chronic infections, such as H. pylori, or acute infections, such as enterovirus.Non-inflammatory forms of \"gastritis\" are histologically termed gastropathy. These may be caused by chemical irritants to the stomach, including alcohol and medications.

-   Presentation

    -   Inflammation or irritation of the stomach lining often causing sharp epigastric pain.

    -   This pain may be variably worsened or improved with eating food.

    -   Patients with inflammation of the stomach may have nausea and decreased appetite.

    -   exaggerated by stress/emotions, diet, medications (particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and other things that cause excess acid production such as spicy food.

    -   The bowels are usually not affected unless there is a component of irritable bowel syndrome and stress. In that case there may be either decreased or increased stooling.

### GERD

GERD is a chronic relapsing condition in which gastric contents reflux through the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) into the esophagus and oropharynx. Transient LES relaxations are believed to be the primary etiologic factor. Ineffective esophageal clearance (as seen with scleroderma, for example) and delayed gastric emptying (as seen with gastroparesis, for example) may also be contributing factors in some patients. Increased intra-abdominal pressure is also a predisposing factor (obesity/central adiposity, pregnancy, constricting garments), especially in the presence of hiatal hernia.

-   Classic symptoms of retrosternal heartburn and regurgitation, which worsen when

    -   gastric volume is increased (after large meals)

    -   gastric contents are located near the gastroesophageal junction (reclining or bending)

    -   intra-abdominal pressure is increased (such as with obesity, pregnancy, abdominal binders, or girdles).

-   May be associated with regurgitation and, rarely, dysphagia due to esophgeal spasm

-   Nausea, vomiting, hematochezia, and melena are not typically associated with GERD. Hematemesis in the setting of GERD-like symptoms is unusual and represents an alarm symptom indicative of an upper GI bleed warranting prompt GI referral for evaluation and upper endoscopy.

-   Precipitate by

    -   Spicy, acidic, and fatty foods; Chocolate, Mint

    -   Smoking, Alcohol and caffeine

    -   Eating large portions and Lying flat after a meal

    -   Wearing tight clothing around the waist

    -   Some medications (calcium channel blockers, beta-agonists, alpha-adrenergic agonists, theophylline, nitrates, and some sedatives)

-   Atypical signs and symptoms of GERD:

    -   Asthma, especially new onset in an adult with no history of atopy

    -   Chronic cough

    -   Dental enamel loss

    -   Globus sensation

    -   Hoarseness

    -   Noncardiac chest pain

    -   Recurrent laryngitis

    -   Recurrent pharyngitis

    -   Subglottic stenosis

-   Complications\

    -   Poor Quality of Life\
        Patients who have GERD generally report decreased quality of life, reduced productivity, and decreased well-being. In many patients, reported health-related quality of life is lower than age-matched patients who have untreated angina pectoris, diabetes mellitus or chronic heart failure.

    -   Esophagitis - develops when the mucosal defenses that normally counteract the effect of injurious agents are overwhelmed by refluxed acid, pepsin, or bile.

    -   Peptic strictures - from fibrosis and constriction occur in about 10 percent of patients with reflux esophagitis.

    -   Barrett's esophagus - Replacement of the squamous epithelium of the esophagus by columnar epithelium

    -   Adenocarinoma - 2-5% of Barrett's esophagus

### Peptic Ulcer Disease

-   Presentation

    -   Epigastric abdominal pain that improves with meals is the hallmark of PUD. However, in some cases, symptoms of PUD may worsen with meals. For example, gastric ulcer pain may occur 5 to 15 minutes after eating and remain until the stomach empties, which may be up to several hours in duration; the pain may otherwise be absent during times of fasting. Pain from duodenal ulcers is often relieved by eating, drinking milk, or taking antacids but may return anywhere from 90 minutes to four hours after eating a meal. Both gastric and duodenal ulcers may be associated with nausea and vomiting occurring anytime shortly after eating to several hours later.

    -   Hematemesis, if present, suggests more complicated disease, such as bleeding ulcer, and warrants urgent GI referral and endoscopy. Melena commonly occurs in the setting of an upper GI bleed secondary to PUD or hemorrhagic gastritis (e.g., NSAID-gastritis). Hematochezia only occurs in the setting of an upper GI bleed when massive (e.g., variceal rupture).

-   Risk Factors

    -   Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the predominant pharmacologic agents that contribute to the development of PUD. Classically, older adults are at the highest attributable risk of ulceration and perforation due to chronic NSAID use. Chronic NSAID use is a leading cause of morbidity in older adults.

    -   There is no evidence to support a cause-and-effect association between cigarette smoking and PUD. However, cigarette smoking does decrease vascularity to gastric mucosal cells, resulting in decreased rates of mucosal healing after injury, and, in combination with NSAID use or H. pylori infection, increases the risk of ulceration.

    -   Colonization of the stomach by H. pylori renders the underlying mucosa more vulnerable to peptic acid damage by disrupting the mucous layer, liberating enzymes and toxins, and adhering to the gastric epithelium. In addition, the body's immune response to H. pylori incites an inflammatory reaction that contributes to tissue injury and leads to chronic gastritis. In most individuals the chronic gastritis is asymptomatic and does not progress. In some cases, however, altered gastric secretion coupled with tissue injury leads to peptic ulcer disease. In other cases, gastritis progresses to mucosal atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and eventually gastric carcinoma. Rarely, persistent immune stimulation of gastric lymphoid tissue can lead to gastric lymphoma.

    -   Moderate to severe physiologic stress may lead to stress ulceration, predominantly in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

-   Diagnosis: withhold PPI and histamine then conduct Urea Breath Test

    -   Recommend withholding PPI for 7 -- 14 days before UBT; mechanism of increasing false-negative by UBT is poorly defined though hypothesis is pH dependent suppression of H pylori activity; by extrapolation, the use of histamine would also increase the likelihood of UBT false negative result since histamine increases intracellular cAMP which increases secretion of gastric juice

-   Management

    -   Trial of PPI

    -   If fails PPI test for H. pylori

        -   The H. pylori IgG serologic test only confirms evidence of past infection and an immunologic response to H. pylori . In a population with a high prevalence of active H. pylori infection, it is a useful first-time test. However, if the population prevalence of active infection is low, then the test may yield a high number of false-positive results. It should not be used to confirm eradication of H. pylori after treatment as it can remain positive for years.

        -   The urea breath test accurately detects active infection but is more expensive than serologic testing. It is less accurate during PPI therapy, and patients would need to stop the PPI for at least two weeks before a urea breath test (bismuth and antibiotics should also be stopped for at least two weeks before a urea breath test.). However, urea breath testing may be appropriate depending on the characteristics of the population being tested.

        -   The stool antigen test for H. pylori is also accurate and widely available, but it is more expensive and less convenient than serologic testing. The stool antigen and urease breath tests may also be used as confirmatory tests after a positive serologic test.

        -   If alarming symptoms develop or if patient is on PPI, antibiotics, or bismuth, perform endoscopoc testing for H. pylori

        If H. pylori infection confirmed,

        -   Triple therapy for 10 - 14 days (70 - 85% eradication rate): PPI dose bid, amoxicillin 1 g bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid

        -   Quadruple therapy for 10 - 14 days (75 - 90% eradication rate): PPI once or twice daily, metronidazole 250 mg 4x/day, tetracycline 500 mg 4x/day, biosmuth subsalicylate 525 mg 4x/day

        -   For patients with penicillin allergy: PPI bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid, metronidazole 500 mg bid

    -   If H. pylori is not present

        -   Tricyclic antidepressants have been found to improve symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia without affecting the sensation of gastric distention.

        -   Prokinetics have been found to improve symptoms of functional dyspepsia, specifically early satiety and bloating, though the evidence supporting this is of low-quality.

        -   A systematic review determined that there is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of psychological therapies---including cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy, relaxation training and interpersonal therapy---for the treatment of functional dyspepsia. However, individual trials have reported some modest clinical benefits in symptomatic improvement.

        -   Alternative therapies are gaining popularity in patients with gastrointestinal conditions, and studies of varying quality suggest that slippery elm, capsaicin, peppermint oil, caraway oil, and artichoke leaf may improve symptoms in some patients. However, there is as yet no compelling evidence on which to base a recommendation for these alternative therapies. Note: Peppermint oil decreases lower esophageal sphincter pressure and may worsen GERD symptoms. Patients should be educated that herbal remedies are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), may not have been studied for safety, and can have adverse side effects, which very often include GI side effects.

    -   Rule out GI bleeding

        -   If symptoms have not improved, it is reasonable to consider fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) to rule out occult bleeding.

        -   Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) is more sensitive and specific than FOBT for detecting occult lower GI bleeding; however, it is not suitable for detecting gastric bleeding, and it should not be used if the suspected source of bleeding is proximal to the ligament of Treitz.

        -   The guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (FOBT), such as Hemoccult II SENSA, are best used to check for occult upper GI bleeding.

        -   Multiple negative FOBTs or FITs do not exclude the presence of either upper or lower GI blood loss. Diets high in red meat, iron, and vitamin C may cause false positive results with guaiac-based tests.

        In patients who with a positive FOBT, it is important to obtain a CBC to assess the degree of blood loss and to determine the urgency of GI referral.

    -   If patient fails initial triple or quadruple therapy, perform fecal antigen test and urea breath test are reasonable next steps to evaluate eradication of H. pylori.

        -   The fecal antigen test involves collection of a stool sample the size of an acorn by either the clinician or the patient; the sample is then analyzed in a laboratory by trained personnel.

        -   The urea breath test requires specialized equipment and patient preparation.

        Both tests have been reported to have a sensitivity and specificity for active H. pylori infection of \> 90%. The H. pylori fecal antigen test is less expensive and may be more cost-effective than the urease breath test.

        If the fecal antigen test or the urea breath test is positive, the patient will require re-treatment for a resistant infection with levofloxacin triple therapy, but this should not be given prior to testing for the presence of active H. pylori infection. If the fecal antigen test or urea breath test is negative, and the patient continues to have symptoms, he should be referred to a gastroenterologist for an upper endoscopy/EGD and mucosal biopsy.

        Testing for H. Pylori eradication is also useful in patients with H. pylori-associated MALT lymphoma, history of resection for early gastric cancer, and patients planning to resume chronic NSAID therapy.

### Acute Pancreatitis

-   Presentation

    -   Causes severe abdominal pain, associated with nausea and vomiting

    -   Pain is typically located in the epigastric area with radiation to the back, improves with leaning forward, and worsens with eating. Symptoms often last for many hours without relief, and is unlikely to resolve with bowel rest.

    -   Acute and chronic pancreatitis are most commonly caused by alcohol use and gallstones. Remember that some patients may not be forthcoming about their actual alcohol use, especially if they perceive they are being judged or if they are in denial about problem use/abuse.

    -   May present with shock and coma!

-   Physical

    -   Ill appearance on exam, and clinical signs of dehydration such as tachycardia, jaundice may be seen if there is obstruction of the common bile duct.

    -   Grey Turner Sign: Ecchymotic discoloration in the flank

    -   Cullen sign: Ecchymptoc discoloration in the periumbilical region

-   Diagnosis

    -   Leads to elevations in serum lipase and amylase.

### Pancreatic Cancer

-   Presentation

    -   Depression and associated anxiety may be prodromal features in 1/3 patients with pancreatic cancer; possibly due to increased inflammatory cytokines, a paraneoplastic syndrome, or alterations in pancreatic function

    -   New onset diabetes occur in 1/4 of patients with pancreatic cancer - cancer-indcued beta cell dysfunction or secretion of adrenomedulin (an insulin-regulating peptide hormone)

    -   Increased risk in thin, older patients, with smoking history and marked weight loss

-   Diagnosis

    -   CT of the abdomen

### Biliary Colic

-   Presentation\
    Biliary colic typically causes right upper quadrant pain, epigastric pain or chest pain that is constant (the term \"colic\" is a misnomer), typically lasts 4-6 hours or less, and often radiates to the back (classically under the right shoulder blade). It is often accompanied by nausea or vomiting and often follows a heavy, fatty meal. These symptoms are a result of a stimulated gallbladder (e.g., from a fatty meal) contracting when a gallstone obstructs the outlet of the cystic duct. The hallmark of biliary colic is that the stone is mobile and eventually moves away from the outlet allowing resumption of normal gallbladder function and resolution of symptoms.

### Cholecystitis

-   Presentation\
    RUQ pain from cholecystitis also causes right upper quadrant pain with associated nausea and vomiting and also classically occurs following a large, fatty meal. The pathophysiology of cholecystitis is similar to biliary colic but is caused by a stone that is not dislodged from the cystic duct outlet. In contrast to biliary colic, the symptoms of cholecystitis typically persist, are more severe, and are often associated with fever. An elevated white blood cell count is often present from inflammation of the distended gallbladder wall. It should be noted that these inflammatory changes found with cholecystitis can be acute or chronic. Additionally, the condition of acalculous cholecystitis, in which gall stones are not implicated in the pathophysiology, can occur, particularly in the elderly and the very-ill ICU patient.

-   Physical\

    -   Positive Murphy's sign - high specificity, low sensitivity

### Hepatitis

The clinical manifestations of hepatitis vary somewhat depending on etiology, but most types do not have acute onset, unlike the diseases of the gallbladder tract. While RUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting are frequently encountered, there is often associated malaise, anorexia, itching, and icterus/jaundice. Hepatomegaly is often present.

### Appendicitis

-   The hallmark symptom of appendicitis is right lower quadrant pain

-   It is extremely important to perform a pelvic exam in patients with abdominal pain

-   The pelvic exam is often tender in a patient with an acute abdomen.

-   Patients with acute appendicitis will frequently give a history of having had some vomiting. They generally have nausea, loss of appetite, mild fever, and will usually have decreased stooling or constipation.

### Irritable Bowel Syndrome

IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) typically causes a variety of symptoms which can include abdominal pain, loose stools, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating, increased flatulence and mucus in stools. IBS is generally a diagnosis of exclusion. Symptoms of IBS can be brought on initially by a case of gastroenteritis and can be aggravated by stress, anxiety, and depression, dietary changes or change in activity, and are often unpredictable.

-   Presentation

    -   crampy pain prior to and during menses, but will also occur at other times during the month.

    -   This pain is often associated with diarrhea and/or constipation.

-   Diagnosis: Rome Criteria

    -   Recurrent abdominal pain, on average day per week in past three months with of following features:

        -   related to defecation;

        -   associated with change in stool frequency;

        -   associated with change in stool form (appearance)

        Lab studies are NOT required if other diagnoses are unlikely.

-   Treatment

    -   Offering behavioral therapies and exercise

### Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Inflammatory bowel disease can often be misdiagnosed as a gynecologic problem since constipation and diarrhea are associated with premenstrual syndrome as well. Additionally, when a person has bloody stools during her menses, the clinical diagnosis can be more confusing. However, when there is pain with defecation and bloody stools occur at times other than during menses this diagnosis becomes clearer. Abnormal vaginal bleeding is not a typical symptom of inflammatory bowel disease.

### Diverticulitis

-   Presentation

    -   Classically presents with acute left lower quadrant abdominal pain, change in bowel movements, and fever.

    -   Most common in patients over 50 years of age.

### Inguinal Hernia

An inguinal hernia is a painless swelling in the inguinal region, which can be enhanced by maneuvers that raise intra-abdominal pressure, such as cough or Valsalva maneuver. The swelling becomes painful and tender when it is incarcerated.

Indirect hernia: An indirect inguinal hernia develops as a result of a persistent process vaginalis. The inguinal canal begins in the intra-abdominal cavity at the internal inguinal ring, located approximately midway between the pubic symphysis and the anterior iliac spine. The canal courses down along the inguinal ligament to the external ring, located medial to the inferior epigastric arteries, subcutaneously and slightly above the pubic tubercle. Contents of this hernia then follow the tract of the testicle down into the scrotal sac.

Direct hernia: A direct inguinal hernia usually occurs due to a defect or weakness in the transversalis fascia area of the Hesselbach triangle. The triangle is defined inferiorly by the inguinal ligament, laterally by the inferior epigastric arteries, and medially by the conjoint tendon.
