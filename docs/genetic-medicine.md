Genetic Medicine {#sec:genetics}
================

Pedigree {#ssec:genetics-pedigree}
--------

Key features for different genetic diseases

-   Autosomal dominant: equal chance man and woman

-   Autosomal recessive: skip generations, multiple affected children from unaffected parents.

-   X-link dominant: more female than male

-   X-link recessive: more male than females, skip generation inheret through maternal side

Genetic Tests {#ssec:genetics-tests}
-------------

-   Chromosome/Karyotype analysis

    -   Microscopic study of chromosomes to identify abnormalities in chromosomes number or structure

    -   Commonly ordered when

        -   patients are suspected of having a recognizable chromosomal syndrome

        -   newborns with multiple malformations of unknown etiology

        -   newborns with mbiguious genitalia

-   Direct DNA testing

    -   Indicated for patients affected or predisposed to a condition for which the gene change that causes the condition has been identified e.g. cystic fibrosis

-   Biochemical tests

    -   Identify or quantify metabolites or enzymes to measure activity

    -   Commonly used to diagnose and monitor disorders of metabolism

-   Linkage analysis

    -   Identify genetic sequences that are physically in close proximity to a disease gene of interest
