Inflammatory Myopathies
-----------------------

### Polymyositis

-   Clinical feature

    -   Proximal muscle weakness

-   Lab

    -   anti-jo-1 antibodies

### Dermatomyositis

-   Clinical features

    -   Proximal muscle weakness

    -   Characteristic skin manifestations

-   Lab

    -   anti-jo-1 antibodies
    
-   #### Dermatomyositis / Polymyositis

    Muscle fiber injury

    Clinical feature

    - Symmetrical and more proximal muscle weakness
    - Intersititual lung disease, oesophageal dysmotility, Raynaud phenomenon
    - Polyarthritis
    - Esophageal dysmotility
    - Skin findings (e.g. Gottron papules, héliotrope rash) in dermatomyositis

Systemic Vasculitis
----------

### Henoch-Schonlein Purpura

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) also known as IgA vasculitis, is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and sometimes other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain.

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is characterized by nonthrombocytopenic purpura, arthralgia, renal disease, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and occasionally scrotal pain.

The onset of scrotal pain may be acute or insidious.

In boys who lack other characteristic findings of HSP, sonography can usually distinguish HSP from testicular torsion.

Treatment of HSP is supportive.



## Soft Tissue Rheumatism

### Systemic sclerosis

A connective tissue disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and visceral organs. Gastrointestinal involvement often causes dysphagia due to fibrous tissue replacement of smooth muscle in the esophagus. Esophageal manometry classically shows dysmotility and low LES pressure.

### Ankylosing Spondylitis

There is a strong association between HLA-B27 and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). AS presents in young males (aged 15-30 years) and symptoms include low back pain with limited spinal mobility. Symptoms improve with exercise early in the disease.

Syndromes
---------

### Sjogren Syndrome

Autoimmune disorders characterized by inflammation of the exocrine glands

**Presentation**

-   Exocrine features: Dry mouth, Autoimmune sialoadenitis, Kratoconjunctivitis sicca
-   Extraglandular features: arthritis, Raynaud phenomenon, dyspareunia, cutaneous vasculitis, interstitial lung disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma
-   Sjögren syndrome can present with salivary gland enlargement (typically painless) due to lymphocytic infiltration of the glands. 

**Clinical Feature**

-   Patients are typically women
-   More often affects the parotid glands
-   Secretions are significantly decreased, resulting in both xerostomia and dry eyes.

**Diagnostic**

-   Objective signs of decreased lacrimination (schirmer test)

-   Positive anti-Ro and /or anti-La

-   Salivary gland biopsy with focal lymphocytic sialoadnitis

-   Classification:

    -   Primary if no associated CTD

    -   Secondary is comorbid CTD e.g. SLE, RA, scleroderma

### Systemic Lupus Erythematosis

-   Unlikely without other signs and symptoms accompanying the joint pain, including fever, skin rashes, Raynaud's phenomenon, pleuritis, or chest pain.

-   The typical rash of SLE is a malar \"butterfly\" rash, which appears as an erythematous maculopapular rash over the nose and cheeks that spares the nasolabial folds, and typically occurs or worsens with sun exposure.

-   Discoid lesions can also be present, which look like discrete erythematous placques with scaling.

-   SLE arthritis is also typically migratory.



### Antiphospholipid Syndrome



Arthritis 关节炎
-----------------------------------------

### Septic Arthritis 化脓性关节炎

-   Presentation

    -   Abrupt onset of pain and swelling

    -   Typically only in a single joint

    -   Generalized extreme pain with any movement

    -   Risk factors include diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, prosthetic joints, recent surgery, preceding skin infection or trauma, and being over the age of 80.

-   Physical

    -   Knee exam is usually remarkable for swelling and warmth.

    -   Typically febrile, but older patients may not be febrile

-   Investigation

    -   Arthrocentesis with turbid synovial fluid and an abundance of inflammatory cells (white blood cell count 15K to \> 200K;

    -   Blood: Elevated WBC; Elevated ESR (usually \>50 mm/hr)

### Osteoarthritis 骨性关节炎

-   Presentation

    -   very common
-   Chronic joint stiffness and pain; Usually the large joints are asymmetrically involved.
    -   Can be monoarticular in young adults if due to trauma or a congenital defect, but more commonly presents as polyarticular or generalized arthritis.
-   No acute trauma; though past history of trauma can predispose to developing osteoarthritis
    -   Pain aggrevated by weight-bearing activities, relieved by rest
-   Joint stiffness, if present, is typically worse after effort.



**Diagnosis**

- Knee pain with >/= 3 out of following 6 criteria (sensitivity 95%; specificity 69%)



-   Physical

    -   Generalized or joint line tenderness

    -   Crepitus on exam

    -   Mild or no joint effusion
-   Investigation

**Management**

-   Exercise (best outcome for pain reduction)
    -   Types of resistance, function, coordination
        -   Muscle strengthening exercise
            -   Isometric: static muscle contraction without length change
            -   Isotonic: muscle contraction with constant load through range of motion
            -   Isokinetic: change in muscle length at constant speed with constant tension
        -   Strengthening exercises
            -   Quad sets
            -   Hamstrings sets
            -   Calf stretch (towel / standing)
            -   Knee extension (seated)
            -   Straight leg raise (seated/lying)
            -   Alternate knee extension
            -   Wall half-squats
            -   Heel raises
            -   Sit-stand
    -   Evidence for pain control and reduction of disability
    -   Water- or land-based exercise, aerobic walking, quadriceps strengthening, resistance exercise, tai chi; 
        -   Yoga/Pilates belong to a group of flexibility and core strengthening. 
        -   Tai Chi is aimed at balance training AND strength of quadricep muscles
        -   Stretching exercise improve ROM
    -   When considering exercise: frequency, intensity, time, type, progression, precautions
        -   5 x / week
        -   Moderate (up to 50 -6 0%)
        -   30 min
        -   5 min up to 45 min (no longer to avoid muscle fatigue)
-   Weight loss
-   Occupational therapy in OA
    -   Joint protection:reduce strain on affected joints
    -   Orthoses: e.g. thermoplastic splints
    -   Assistive devices e.g. large handled spoons, long reacher
-   Medications
    -   Acetaminophen:
    -   Not as effective as NSAIDs, but due to much better safety and side-effect profile is recommended as the first choice.

    -   Dosing is **up to 4 gm per day** in divided doses, though the FDA recently recommended lower doses (2-3 gm/day in divided doses) if long-term use is desired.

    -   Little risk of nephrotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity is a rare side effect if taken appropriately.
    -   NSAID

        -   Second choice to acetaminophen because of their association with gastrointestinal side-effects, acute kidney injury and hypertension.

        -   Especially true in the geriatric population because of their increased risk of acute gastrointestinal bleeding, even when used in conjunction with antacids or proton pump inhibitors.

        -   Diclofenac may be the most effective NSAID at reducing pain due to osteoarthritis.

        -   Topical diclofenac (weaker evidence) may provide benefit to some patients with knee osteoarthritis.
    -   Intra-articular corticosteroid injections

        -   Should be considered if the knee joint is inflamed, as evidenced by swelling and pain.
        -   No more than three injections per year, and no more frequent than one injection per month.
        -   Long-acting triamcinolone is typically preferred over methylprednisolone, and 1 ml of steroid should be combined with 3-4 ml local anesthetic.
        -   24 hours of immobilization following the injection helps maximize the effects, but prolonged rest should be avoided.
        -   Can reduce pain, limit the need for other medications, and improve function, but benefit is unclear from the evidence and likely of short duration.
        -   Fewer associated side effects than NSAIDs or opiates.
        -   Other knee injections: hyaluronic acid injections, platelet rich plasma injections
        -   Tramadol (Ultram)

            -   There is good evidence that tramadol can help with pain from osteoarthritis.

            -   Tramadol is an atypical opioid and does have abuse potential, though the risk appears to be significantly lower than that of traditional opiates.

            -   Can lower seizure threshold in patients with epilepsy.
-   Adjuvant
    -   Acupuncture: may provide some benefit
    -   Orthoses and walking aids
    -   Medial patellar taping
    -   Massage therapy
    -   TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation); pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation.
    -   Vitamin D
-   Glucosamine and chondroitin: unlikely to provide benefit
-   To avoid

    -   Laterally directed patellar taping

    -   Knee braces

    -   Laterally wedged insoles

    -   Balance exercises

### Rheumatoid Arthritis 风湿性关节炎

-   Presentation

    -   Can develop at a broad range of ages.

    -   Joint stiffness for more than thirty minutes in the morning is common.

    -   Typically bilateral joint pain, involving three or more joints (in particular the hands or feet).

-   Physical

    -   Can have associated subcutaneous nodules that are firm and nontender, and are located at pressure points.

### Psoriatic Arthritis 银屑病关节炎

-   Presentation

    -   Common clinical manifestations may include peripheral arthritis, nail and skin disease, dactylitis, enthesitis and axial disease.
    -   Clinical pattern is variable, and arthritis may precede skin changes.
    -   Skin findings precede joint symptoms in up to 75% of patients.
    -   Can be difficult to distinguish from RA if skin changes not present, though less common.

### Reactive Arthritis (Reiter Syndrome) 反应性关节炎



### Crystal Arthropathies

#### Gout 痛风

-   Presentation

    -   Acute pain and swelling without prior trauma

    -   Occurs in recurrent episodes of acute unilateral pain and swelling lasting days to weeks.

    -   Most common joint is the first metatarsophalangeal joint, though other joints such as the knees are commonly affected.

-   Physical

    -   Painful joint to touch

    -   Can be associated with tophi which are visible or palpable nodules often located on the ears or in the soft tissue. Tophi can also form in the bones, joints, and cartilage. They are typically not painful, and take years to develop.

-   Investigation

    -   Arthrocentesis with clear or slightly cloudy synovial fluid with Negatively birefringent rods

#### Pseudogout 假痛风
