Inflammatory Myopathies
-----------------------

### Polymyositis

-   Clinical feature

    -   Proximal muscle weakness

-   Lab

    -   anti-jo-1 antibodies

### Dermatomyositis

-   Clinical features

    -   Proximal muscle weakness

    -   Characteristic skin manifestations

-   Lab

    -   anti-jo-1 antibodies

Vasculitis
----------

### Henoch-Schonlein Purpura

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) also known as IgA vasculitis, is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and sometimes other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain.

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is characterized by nonthrombocytopenic purpura, arthralgia, renal disease, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and occasionally scrotal pain.

The onset of scrotal pain may be acute or insidious.

In boys who lack other characteristic findings of HSP, sonography can usually distinguish HSP from testicular torsion.

Treatment of HSP is supportive.

Syndromes
---------

### Sjogren Syndrome

Autoimmune disorders characterized by inflammation of the exocrine glands

-   Presentation

    -   Exocrine features: Dry mouth, Autoimmune sialoadenitis, Kratoconjunctivitis sicca

    -   Extraglandular features: arthritis, Raynaud phenomenon, dyspareunia, cutaneous vasculitis, interstitial lung disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma

-   Diagnostic

    -   Objective signs of decreased lacrimination (schirmer test)

    -   Positive anti-Ro and /or anti-La

    -   Salivary gland biopsy with focal lymphocytic sialoadnitis

    -   Classification:

        -   Primary if no associated CTD

        -   Secondary is comorbid CTD e.g. SLE, RA, scleroderma

### Systemic Lupus Erythematosis

-   Unlikely without other signs and symptoms accompanying the joint pain, including fever, skin rashes, Raynaud's phenomenon, pleuritis, or chest pain.

-   The typical rash of SLE is a malar \"butterfly\" rash, which appears as an erythematous maculopapular rash over the nose and cheeks that spares the nasolabial folds, and typically occurs or worsens with sun exposure.

-   Discoid lesions can also be present, which look like discrete erythematous placques with scaling.

-   SLE arthritis is also typically migratory.
