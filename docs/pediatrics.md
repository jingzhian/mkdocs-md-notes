## General

### Primitive Reflexes

| Reflex            | When it disappear   | Description |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| Moro              |                     |             |
| Grasp             |                     |             |
| Tongue Protrusion | 4 - 6 months        |             |
| Babinski reflex   | 12 months - 2 years |             |

### Changes After Birth

- Dry, flaky, peeling skin of the hands and feet is expected as the skin adjusts to the dry extrauterine environment. 
- The appearance of "pink stains" or "brick dust" in neonatal diapers represent uric acid crystals. Uric acid excretion is especially high at birth and decreases until adolescence, when adult levels are observed.  Uric acid crystals are commonly seen during the first week as the mother’s milk is coming in, or in later months with the morning void after the infant begins to sleep through the night.

### Breastfeeding

Contracindications to direct breastfeeding include

1. Herpetic breast lesions
2. Peripartum varicella infection

Mother with history of herpes labialis and childhood varicella infection should be encouraged to breastfeed.



healthy neonates normally lose **up to 7% of their birth weight** in the **first 5 days** of life due to excretion of excess fluid acquired in utero and during labor. The weight loss is more pronounced in exclusively breastfed infants as the mother's milk supply gradually increases to meet infant demands. Frequent breastfeeding should be encouraged, and education about dehydration should be provided.

Signs of dehydration include dry mucous membranes, a sunken fontanelle, and decreased urine output. As a general rule, the number of wet diapers should equal age in days for the first week of life. For example, a 4-day-old neonate should have >4 wet diapers per day. After the first week, infants should have >6 wet diapers per day. **Birth weight should be regained by age 10-14 days**.

 Breast milk fortified with powdered infant formula may be used for infants with failure to thrive or for preterm infants but is not recommended for physiologic neonatal weight loss.

Intravenous fluids should be reserved for dehydrated infants who cannot ingest adequate oral nutrition. 

Serum electrolytes, particularly serum sodium, can be used as a measure of dehydration. Infants who lose >7% of birth weight or appear dehydrated on examination are at risk for life-threatening hypernatremic dehydration. 

Infants have immature kidneys that cannot reabsorb sodium effectively. Plain water should never be given to infants age <6 months as it can dilute the blood, resulting in dangerous hyponatremia and seizures.



### Developmental Milestones

Every well-child examination should include an assessment of developmental milestones, as prompt recognition allows for early intervention with therapies to optimize both skill acquisition and overall long-term health.

- Normal childhood separation anxiety should be distinguished from separation anxiety disorder. In the latter, children have an unreasonable fear of being separated from a loved one and can present with severe symptoms, such as panic attacks and vomiting. Children with these symptoms should undergo a psychological evaluation.

### Toilet Training and Bed Wetting

Most children are ready to **begin toilet-training** at **age 2-4 years** with the acquisition of the following skills:

- Walking
- Imitating others' actions (eg, sitting on toilet)
- Following 2-step commands
- Removing pants
- Communicating the need to urinate and stool
- Voluntarily controlling sphincters

Premature initiation of toilet-training can prolong the duration of training. Once developmentally ready, most children master daytime continence within months, but nighttime continence can sometimes take years to accomplish. Parents should be **reassured** that **bedwetting is normal before age 5**. Also, boys generally complete toilet-training later than girls. Most cases even beyond age 5 resolve spontaneously but often require intervention due to family and child frustration or embarrassment.

#### Primary Enuresis

When incontinence persists beyond age 4, urinalysis should be performed to screen for urinary tract infection, diabetes mellitus, and diabetes insipidus.

#### Secondary Enuresis

Secondary enuresis, or return of incontinence after ≥6 months of dryness, can be caused by social stressors (eg, divorce, new school) and may improve by addressing such stressors in therapy. 

#### Nocturnal Enuresis

 defined by urinary incontinence in children age ≥5.

 Enuresis alarm therapy and initiation of desmopressin are considered first-line therapies



### Screening

#### Autism Screening

Autism screening is routinely performed at ages 18 months and 2 years

#### Electrocardiographic screening 

in asymptomatic children may be indicated if there is a significant family history of premature cardiac death (ie, at age <50). Routine screening in children is not recommended due to the risk of false-positive results and low incidence.

#### Routine lipid screening 

in children and young adults is performed at ages 9-11 and 17-21 because lipid levels are relatively stable just before and after puberty.

#### Vision 

**Vision** is evaluated at **every well-child visit**, as untreated eye abnormalities during the first few years of life can lead to permanent vision loss. Infants and young children are assessed by observation of visual behavior. For example, infants can fixate on objects shortly after birth, and by age 3 months they demonstrate horizontal and vertical tracking. Red reflex testing is also performed to detect a congenital cataract or retinoblastoma, and corneal light reflex testing assesses ocular alignment. In older infants and children, strabismus can also be detected by the cover test, in which a child focuses on an object and each eye is covered independently to assess for abnormal movement in the contralateral, fixated eye.

**Visual acuity testing** is performed routinely at **age 4** but can be performed as early as age 3 in cooperative children. The Snellen chart is the gold standard, although the HOTV (4-letter) or LEA (picture) chart may be used for young children with limited or no ability to identify letters. Visual acuity worse than 20/40 at age 4 or worse than 20/30 at age ≥5 should prompt ophthalmologic evaluation for refractive errors. Additional indications for referral include pupillary asymmetry of ≥1 mm, nystagmus, and ptosis or other conditions obstructing the visual field.

#### Depression Screening

depression screening starts at age 12



## Frameworks

### Pediatrics Fever and Rash

#### Measles

Koplik spots are erythematous buccal or pharyngeal lesions that are pathognomonic for measles; they typically develop and disappear prior to the onset of the measles rash, which spreads in a cephalocaudal pattern. Classic manifestations of measles include cough, coryza.

#### Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever

Petechiae would be expected in Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which can present with rash and fever. Patients often have severe abdominal pain, and the rash typically spreads from the extremities toward the trunk,

#### Scarlet Fever

Scarlet fever may present with fever, exudative pharyngitis, and a sandpaper-like rash most prominent along the skinfolds (eg, axillae, groin). 


### Precocious Puberty

This child has early breast and pubic hair development consistent with **precocious puberty**, the onset of secondary sexual characteristics in girls age <8 or boys age <9. Central precocious puberty is due to early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Peripheral precocity is attributed to premature secretion of sex hormones independent of GnRH.

Child Abuse
------------

### Abuse by Scalding
Scald injuries account for the majority of burns in pediatric patients.  Child abuse can present as a scald injury and should be considered in all cases.  Deliberate immersion burns usually involve the buttocks, back, and legs if the child is forced into a bathtub with hot water.  These burns typically spare flexural creases due to ankle, knee, and hip flexion at the time of forced immersion.  A stocking or glove burn distribution with a sharp line of demarcation and uniform burn depth may also be seen if an extremity is forced into hot liquid.  An absence of burn in the distribution of splash marks is often noted as well.

Additional red flags for child abuse include a caregiver's history of an injury that is inconsistent or does not correlate with physical findings (eg, hot liquid spill without splash marks).  A delay in seeking treatment should also raise concern for child abuse.  If a health care provider suspects that a child has been abused or neglected, the local child protective services agency should be notified immediately.

### Unintentional Scald Injuries
Unintentional scald injuries are characterized by the presence of splash marks, nonuniform burn depth, and poorly defined and asymmetric wound margins.  The most common unintentional scald injury in young children occurs after a hot liquid spill from an elevated surface and results in facial, proximal upper extremity, and superior trunk burns.

Educational objective:
Child abuse in the form of deliberate scald injuries is characterized by burns with sharp lines of demarcation, uniform depth, lack of splash marks, and spared flexural creases.
## Pediatric Emergencies

### Shock

In pediatric patients requiring emergency fluid resuscitation, When intravenous access cannot be obtained in emergency cases, **intraosseous (IO)** access should be attempted immediately. IO access requires less skill and practice than central line placement, and clinical trials have demonstrated IO lines to be safer and faster than central lines. IO catheters provide a cannula large enough to deliver fluids and medications rapidly and to obtain blood samples for laboratory testing.

The most common site for IO access is the **proximal tibia** due to its wide, flat surface and distance from the sternum in case cardiopulmonary resuscitation is performed simultaneously. However, any large bone can be used. IO catheters can be placed manually or with a driver. Contraindications to IO placement include infection (eg, cellulitis) overlying the access site, fracture or previous IO attempts in the chosen extremity, or bone fragility (eg, osteogenesis imperfecta).



Other Syndromes
---------------

### Peutz-Jeghers syndrome 

is characterized by gastrointestinal tract hamartomatous polyposis. The associated skin lesions are small (1-5 mm), perioral, mucocutaneous pigmented macules. Patients do not undergo precocious puberty.

### Sturge-Weber syndrome

Characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, and visual impairment due to capillary-venous malformations. The associated skin lesion is a port-wine stain over the territory of the trigeminal nerve. There is no associated precocious puberty.

### Kallmann Syndrome

A disorder of migration of fetal olfactory and GnRH-producing neurons, resulting in rhinencephalon hypoplasia and **hypogonadotropic hypogonadism**. Most cases are X-linked recessive; however, girls can be affected via sporadic, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive mutations.

**Presentation**

- **Delayed puberty**: lack of secondary sexual characteristics in girls age ≥12.
- **Anosmia** (ie, inability to distinguish odors)

**Clinical Features**

- **low FSH and LH levels**: Due to the lack of GnRH production and release from the hypothalamus, the pituitary does not release gonadotropins
- (Girls) short stature, primary amenorrhea, and no breast development: low gonadotropin levels do not stimulate the ovary to produce estrogen

**Management**

- facilitating development of secondary sexual characteristics in adolescents and improving fertility in adults.

### Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)

Patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) or 5-alpha-reductase deficiency are genotypic males (46,XY) who present as phenotypic females. Patients with AIS have breast development but no pubic and axillary hair. Patients with 5-α-reductase deficiency have virilization (eg, clitoromegaly) at puberty and no breast development. In both cases, patients have primary amenorrhea (no uterus) but normal to high FSH and LH levels.



### CHARGE Syndrome

**Characteristic Features**

- Coloboma
- Heart defects (eg, TOF, VSD)
- Atresia choanae: 
  - classically presents with cyanosis at rest or with feeding and improvement with crying
  - The inability to pass a catheter beyond the proximal nares is characteristic. 
- Retardation of growth/development
- Genitourinary anomalies
- Ear abnormalities (eg, hearing loss)

Additional findings

- Anosmia
- Cleft lip/palate
- Hypotonia

Diagnosis

- Clinical
- CHD7 gene testing

Management

- Initial management of infants with CHARGE syndrome includes placement of an oral airway for respiratory support in patients with choanal atresia. 
- Screening echocardiogram and renal ultrasound are also indicated. 
- Children with CHARGE syndrome require lifelong, multispecialty care due to delays in development, puberty, and growth.

### VACTERL

VACTERL (**V**ertebral, **A**nal atresia, **C**ardiac, **T**racheo**e**sophageal fistula, **R**enal, **L**imb) syndrome has several features in common with CHARGE, including cardiac and renal anomalies. However, coloboma and choanal atresia are not present in infants with this condition.

### Velocardiofacial Syndrome (VCFS)

-   Clinical features

    -   Face: Elongated face, retrognathia, prominent nose

    -   Hypernasal speech

    -   Cardiac defects

    -   A/W learning disability, schizophrenia, paranoia

### Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

### Fanconi anemia

Infants with Fanconi anemia may have genital abnormalities, abnormal ears, and heart defects but also often have abnormal skin pigmentation and hypoplastic thumbs (not seen here). In addition, colobomas and choanal atresia are not seen in Fanconi anemia.

## MSK Conditions

### **Duchenne muscular dystrophy**

This patient has early signs of **Duchenne muscular dystrophy** (DMD), an X-linked recessive disorder that causes markedly reduced or absent dystrophin in muscle fibers. It is the most common muscular dystrophy in children and is characterized by severe, **progressive muscle weakness**.

Typical presentation involves a toddler who has **gross motor delay** but demonstrates normal fine motor and language skills (as seen in this patient). Patients with DMD usually do not **walk** independently until age **>18 months** and often have difficulty running, jumping, and climbing stairs. Frequent falls and fatigue with activity are common.

**Gower sign**, in which patients push their hands on their legs to assist in standing, is typically present from an early age due to proximal lower extremity muscle weakness and atrophy. By early childhood, calf enlargement due to muscle replacement by fat (ie, pseudohypertrophy) also develops. Progressive weakness leads to joint contractures, and most patients are wheelchair-dependent by adolescence.

A **creatine kinase level** is the initial screening tool used to assess for myopathy and is markedly **elevated** in children with DMD. As the disease progresses, the creatine kinase level drops as more muscle is replaced by fat and fibrosis. Dystrophin gene mutation on **genetic analysis** is diagnostic.

**Presentation**

Typically a boy age <5 with difficulty walking, jumping, and climbing stairs due to **proximal muscle weakness**. Patients have trouble keeping up with other children and have decreased endurance (as in this patient). To compensate for the weakness, patients will frequently use their hands to "walk up" their legs in order to stand (Gower sign).

**Clinical Features**

- Onset at age 2-3
- **Calf pseudohypertrophy**, in which the calf is enlarged due to muscle replacement by fat, is characteristic of DMD
- **diminished reflexes** can occur with loss of strength and tone
- Over time, contractures develop in the Achilles tendons, causing patients to toe-walk, and most patients are wheelchair-dependent by adolescence.
- Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Scoliosis

**Investigation**

- ↑ Serum creatine kinase
- Genetic testing: dystrophin deletion
- Muscle biopsy: fibrosis, fat, muscle degeneration

**Diagnosis** is confirmed by genetic testing.

**Prognosis**

- Wheelchair dependent by adolescence
- Death at age 20-30 from respiratory/heart failure

**Management**

- **Glucocorticoids** help improve function and delay disease progression. 

### Myasthenia gravis

caused by antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor on the postsynaptic membrane. Patients most commonly have fluctuating weakness and fatiguability of the ocular muscles. The disease is rare in children, and isolated proximal lower extremity weakness is atypical.

### Viral myositis 

(ie, viral inflammation of muscle fibers) typically presents with acute muscle pain and weakness in the setting of a viral illness. This patient's prolonged symptoms and lack of muscle tenderness make viral myositis unlikely.

### Botulism

Botulism, due to neurotransmitter neurotoxin blockade, causes symmetric descending weakness from the cranial nerves to the trunk and upper extremities. In contrast, this patient has lower extremity weakness.

### Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) 

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is due to cross-reactivity of antibodies against an infection with peripheral nerve axons. Patients have ascending weakness and diminished reflexes. Although this patient has had recent upper respiratory infections, which are common in early childhood, progression of GBS typically occurs quickly over a couple of weeks, not months. Calf pseudohypertrophy would not be expected.



### Ehlers-Danlos syndrome

a collagen disorder characterized by scoliosis, joint laxity, and aortic dilation. Patients with this disorder do not have the disproportionately tall stature, lens dislocation, or pectus carinatum seen in Marfan syndrome.

## Infections of the Childhood

### Congenital infections

#### Congenital Zika Syndrome

Zika virus can be transmitted via an Aedes mosquito bite or sexually transmitted from an infected partner. Women infected with ZIka vrus are frequently asymptomatic; however, during pregnancy, transplacental maternal-fetal viral transmission may occur and result in fetal disease.

-   Presentation

    -   History of maternal travel to tropical, mosquito-infested regions

    -   Severe microencephaly (occipitofrontal circumference \>3 standard deviations below the mean)

    -   Thin cerebral cortices with multiple intracranial calcifications due to tissue necrosis

    -   Closed anterior fontanelle (craniosynostosis), multiple contractures, and hypertonicity

### Pediatric Infections

#### Polio 小儿麻痹症

#### Chicken Pox 水痘

#### Measles 麻疹

#### Mumps 腮腺炎

#### Rubella 德国麻疹

#### Diptheria 白喉

#### Pertussis 百日咳

#### *Neisseria meningitidis* meningitis 

This is rare in infants and presents suddenly (over hours) with fever, rash (often petechial), and lethargy. This patient's 2-week history of fever and coronary artery dilation make KD the most likely diagnosis.

#### Myocarditis - Coxsackievirus

Coxsackievirus is the most common cause of pediatric myocarditis and presents with fever, LV dysfunction, and heart failure.  The rash of coxsackievirus classically presents as papulovesicular lesions on the hands, feet, and mouth.

Differential:

- Kawasaki: rash location, lack of coronary artery abnormalities

### Infection Reactions

#### Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome

This patient's presentation is consistent with **hemolytic uremic syndrome** (HUS), which is characterized by the triad of **hemolytic anemia**, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Most commonly seen in children, HUS usually occurs due to Shiga toxin–producing **diarrheagenic pathogens** such as *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 or, less commonly, *Shigella*.

Children with HUS often have fatigue, pallor, and bruising following resolution of a diarrheal (possibly bloody) illness. Laboratory findings include **thrombocytopenia** and anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis (eg, elevated indirect bilirubin, schistocytes). **Acute kidney injury** is manifested by an elevated creatinine and may present with hematuria, proteinuria, oliguria/anuria, and secondary hypertension.

Management of HUS is supportive and includes correction of fluid/electrolyte disturbances and treatment of hypertension. Profound anemia (hemoglobin <6 g/dL) requires transfusion, and dialysis is indicated for severe kidney injury (eg, anuria). HUS improves in most patients within 2-3 weeks.

normal PT and aPTT.

#### Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis

 causes hematuria, hypertension, and acute kidney injury. Thrombocytopenia and anemia are not common, and preceding symptoms include group A streptococcal skin or throat infection, not diarrhea.

#### Immune thrombocytopenia

presents with isolated thrombocytopenia, often after a viral infection. Unlike HUS, anemia and acute kidney injury are not seen.



## Antenatal Development Problems

### Intrauterine Conditions

#### Amniotic band sequence

-   Presentation

    -   Limb defects (e.g. amputation, hand defects, clubfoot)

    -   Craniofacial defects

    -   Abdominal wall defects

### Intrapartum Trauma

#### Erb-Duchenne Palsy

The most common type of brachial plexus injury involving 5th 6th and sometimes 7th cervical nerves.

-   Presentation

    -   Weakness of the deltoid and infraspinatus muscles (C5), biceps (C6), and wrist / finger extensors (C7) leads to predominance of the opposing muscles. The resulting appearance is the characteristic \"waiter's tip\" posture.

-   Treatment

    -   Observation and physical therapy - 80% have spontaneous recovery within 3 months

    -   Prognosis depends on if the damage resulted from mild nerve stretching or compression as opposed to severe rupture or avulsion.

    -   In patients who are not improving, may use MRI of the cervical spine to detect proximal nerve root avulsion, which typically requires surgical repair.

    -   Surgical intervention (e.g. nerve gradt, reconstruction, decompression) is considered for infants with no improvement by age 3 - 9 months but is not necessarily curative.

Jervell & Lange-Nielsen syndrome Romano-Ward Syndrome

## Connective Tissue Diseases

### Osteogenesis Imperfecta

This is collagen defect disease with a spectrum of severity ranging from mild (type I), moderate (type III-IX), to severe (type II).

-   Presentation

    -   Type II is autosomal dominant due to defect in type I collagen synthesis that results in decreased bone density and increased skeletal fragility. Often found on antenatal U/S with multiple fractures, shortened femur, hypoplastic thoracic cage, and growth restriction.

-   Management

    -   Type II is lethal, most fetuses either die in utero, during delivery due to trauma, or shortly after delivery due to pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to hypoplastic thoracic cage.

### Achondroplasia

Non-lethal autosomal dominant bone dysplasia

-   Presentation

    -   Frontal bossing

    -   Macrocephaly

    -   Midface hypoplasia

    -   Genu varum

    -   Limb shortening

## Inflammatory Diseases

### Vasculitis

#### Kawasaki Disease

This infant with ventricular dysfunction and coronary artery abnormalities during a prolonged, febrile illness likely has **Kawasaki disease** (KD). KD is an acute vasculitis characterized by ≥5 days of fever and ≥4 criteria: nonexudative conjunctivitis (eg, injected conjuctivae); mucositis (eg, pharyngitis); edema/erythema of hands/feet (eg, bilateral lower extremity edema); polymorphous rash (eg, macular rash with areas of confluence); and cervical lymphadenopathy >1.5 cm (not seen in this patient).

Although KD is self-limited, untreated patients are at risk for developing life-threatening cardiovascular sequelae, particularly **coronary artery aneurysms**. The dilated arteries are prone to thrombosis, potentially leading to myocardial ischemia and death. **Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction** due to systemic or myocardial inflammation may occur and, in young children, manifests as tiredness, poor feeding, and diaphoresis during feeds. Lower extremity edema and hepatomegaly occur with progressive LV overload. Tachypnea, tachycardia, and an S3 gallop on auscultation are characteristic.

**Prolonged fevers** (>10 days), **delayed treatment** with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and **age <1** are risk factors for cardiac complications. Most aneurysms regress over time, and LV dysfunction typically improves with intravenous immunoglobulin administration.

Cardiac sequelae of Kawasaki disease include coronary artery aneurysms and ventricular dysfunction. These complications are more common in infants and those with prolonged fevers or treatment delay.

**Kawasaki disease** (KD) is a systemic vasculitis that most commonly presents at age <5 in children who are of East Asian ancestry. In addition to **prolonged fever** (≥5 days), patients have at least 4 of the 5 following mucocutaneous findings:

- Conjunctivitis: Bilateral, nonexudative, limbus sparing
- Oral mucosal changes: Erythema, fissured lips, "strawberry tongue"
- Polymorphous rash
- Extremity changes: Erythema, edema, desquamation of the hands and feet
- Cervical lymphadenopathy: >1.5-cm node

Diagnosis is often delayed in children age >5 due to the relatively infrequent incidence of KD in this age group. A high index of suspicion must be maintained, as the diagnostic physical findings do not present in a particular order and may not manifest until the second week of illness, as in this patient. Treatment is with intravenous immunoglobulin within 10 days of fever onset to decrease the risk of coronary artery aneurysm.

#### Henoch Schonlein Purpura

**Henoch-Schönlein purpura** (HSP) is an IgA-mediated vasculitis that occurs most commonly in children during the fall, winter, and spring months. Symptoms are often preceded by a mild upper respiratory tract infection which may involve low-grade fever and cough.

**Clinical Features**

- Palpable purpura, esp on the lower extremities 
- Arthritis/arthralgia
- Abdominal pain: localized bowel wall inflammation
- Renal disease similar to IgA nephropathy  (**hematuria** ± proteinuria)

**Complications**

* Intussusception: 
  * most common GI complication
  * **intestinal edema** and **bleeding** associated with HSP act as a lead point for the intestines to telescope into the adjacent bowel
  * In contrast to most idiopathic intussusception in children, which is typically ileocolic, intussusception in HSP is usually confined to the small bowel (ileoileal). 

#### Takayasu Arteritis

Takayasu arteritis (TA) is characterized by large-vessel (eg, subclavian artery) inflammation, but coronary artery abnormalities can develop. However, TA presents with gradual symptoms of arterial dilation or occlusion (eg, limb pain, lightheadedness) in patients age >10.

### Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Hemolytic anemia may occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Although this disease causes rash, arthralgia/arthritis, and renal disease, skin manifestations typically include a malar or discoid rash rather than palpable purpura on the buttocks.

Cardiac manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) include pericarditis, myocarditis, Libman-Sacks endocarditis, and coronary artery disease. Aside from neonatal lupus, SLE is rare in infancy and does not present acutely with high fevers as seen in this patient.

### Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

Uveitis is a complication of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which typically presents with chronic joint swelling, often involving multiple joints. 

### Reactive Arthritis

Urethritis occurs with reactive arthritis, which presents with joint swelling and is typically preceded by an enteric infection (eg, *Campylobacter*, *Shigella*) causing diarrhea rather than an upper respiratory illness.

### Septic Arthritis

Septic arthritis, which presents with fever and joint pain/swelling, can result in joint destruction if left untreated. In contrast, arthritis associated with HSP is self-limiting and does not cause long-term joint damage.

### Ataxia Telangiectasia

A neurodegenerative, inherited disease causing severe disability; presents in early childhood (the toddler stage) when children begin to walk; presents with cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasia, immunodeficiency.

Breast Feeding All vitamin are adequate through breast milk other than vitamin D and vitamin K Give Vitamin K as IM at birth All exclusively breastfed dark-skinned infants who are not exposed to ample sunlight should get Vitamin D



### Prematurity Problems

#### Intraventricular Hemorrhage

Originate from germinal matrix, a highly cellular and vascularized layer in subventricular zone from which neurons and glial cells migrate out during brain development, and contains numerous thin-walled vessels lacking glial fibers that support other blood vessels.

-   Presentation

    -   Most frequently in infants born before 32 weeks gestation (because germinal matrix become less prominent afterwards) and or with birthweight \< 1500g

    -   Hx of hemodynamic instability - premature infants have impaired autoregulation of cerebral blood flow

    -   Occurs within 5 postnatal days

    -   Can be silent or decrease consciousness, hypotonia, decreased spontaneous movements

    -   If catastrophic: bulging fontanelle, hypotension, decerebrate posturing, tonic-clonic seizures, irregular respiration and coma

-   Cx

    -   Long term neurodevelopmental impairment

## Pediatric Gastrointestinal Conditions

### Volvulus

or intestinal malrotation, presents with abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting (often bilious). 

### Intussusception

episodic abdominal pain and "**currant jelly**" or bloody stools; the presence of a "target" sign on ultrasound is diagnostic

Although ileocolic intussusceptions are treated with air or contrast enema, ileoileal intussusceptions that do not reduce spontaneously often require surgical management.

Metabolic Diseases
------------------

### Lesch-Nyhan syndrome 

Results from a deficiency of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase enzyme, resulting in marked **hyperuricemia**. It is characterized by self-mutilation, mental retardation, and extrapyramidal symptoms (eg, dystonia, choreoathetosis).

Parents should be reassured that urinary uric acid crystals rarely represent a disorder of purine metabolism (eg, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). No workup is necessary if the infant is feeding, growing, and urinating normally.

### Childhood Obesity

For children and teens, BMI age- and sex-specific percentiles are used to interpret the BMI for two reasons:

-   The amount of body fat changes with age.

-   The amount of body fat differs between girls and boys.

Healthy is 5 - 85 th percentile, overweight is up to 95th percentile, and obese is higher than 95th percentile.

Nearly 17 percent of children and adolescents age two to 19 years are obese.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)

Endorse universal screening using body mass index (BMI) and use of BMI growth curves to identify obese and overweight children.

The United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF)

USPSTF has determined that there is fair evidence that body mass index (BMI) is a reasonable measure for identifying children and adolescents who are overweight or are at risk for becoming overweight. They have also determined that there is fair evidence that overweight adolescents and children aged 8 years and older are at increased risk for becoming obese adults.

The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen children aged 6 years and older for obesity and offer them or refer them to comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention to promote improvement in weight status (Grade of Evidence B).

Use the word \"unhealthy weight\" during weight counseling.

Increasing Pediatric Health Issues Type II diabetes has become more common among 6-19 year olds, comprising 8 to 45 percent of all new cases of diabetes.The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in persons younger than 20 years old is about 1 in 400.

Risk factors - BMI at or above the 85 percentile, an increased fasting glucose level of 100mg/dL, and an elevated fasting insulin level. Recommended screening - Screen all children at age 10 who have a BMI \>85 percentile and risk factors for diabetes or \>95 percentile without risk factors, rechecking every two years thereafter. High cholesterol (serum cholesterol levels greater than 200mg/dL) - has been found in 10 percent of children 2 to 19 years of age. This is higher than it was previously.

Risk factors - The strongest risk factor is elevated BMI. Recommended screening - Check a fasting lipid profile on every child with a BMI of \>85 percentile. The goal total cholesterol is 170 mg/dL. The goal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is 130 mg/dL. Treatment - Initial treatment includes diet and exercise. Drug treatment is recommended for children who have an LDL \>190 mg/dL or and LDL \> 160 mg/dL with risk factors. Drug treatment is only recommended for children who are older than 10 and who are either Tanner stage 2 (male) or have achieved menarche. Hypertension incidence in children has increased from 1-3

Risk factors - The strongest risk factor is obesity. Complications - Hypertension in children can lead to hypertension in adults and put them at risk for cardiovascular complications. Metabolic syndrome

Defined in adults as having at least three of the following, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, elevated fasting blood glucose levels, excessive waist circumference, or hypertension, affects 20 percent of adults ages 20 to 40, and 40 percent older than 40 years of age. They are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. While there is no agreed upon definition for metabolic syndrome in children, if we apply the diagnostic criteria to children, substituting elevated BMI for waist circumference, we have started to see increased rates in adolescents. Seven percent of overweight adolescents, 29 percent of obese adolescents, and 50 percent of severely obese adolescents meet the criteria for metabolic syndrome and will have increased health risks. Smoking also increases the risk of metabolic syndrome.

Other complications of obesity

Musculoskeletal disorders such as Blount disease (progressive bowing of the legs) or slipped femoral epiphysis (leads to hip or knee pain). Gastrointestinal problems including steatosis and gallbladder disease. New recommendations include screening for steatosis at age 10 if BMI is greater than 95 percentile, or if greater than the 84-94 percentile but with risk factors and every two years thereafter with an AST and ALT and refer to gastroenterology for levels that are twice the upper limit of normal. Gynecological problems including early menarche and polycystic ovary syndrome can also be seen in overweight females. Skin concerns such as acanthosis nigricans (darkening of the skin around the neck), and intertrigo (inflammation of skinfolds caused by skin-on-skin friction, initially presents as red plaques, almost in a mirror image, on each side of the skin fold) are more common among overweight children. Psychosocial problems including: stigmatization, bullying, low self-esteem, and depression. Obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, pseudotumor cerebri are also more common among overweight children.

Pediatric Weight Management Recommentation

1.  Prevention plus: starting place for all

2.  Structured weight management: if no improvement on prevention plus

3.  Comprehensive multidisciplinary intervention: if still obese

4.  Tertiary care intervention: if 6 - 18 year old

Children younger than 7 years old who have a BMI at or above the 95 percentile without secondary complications should attempt to maintain their weight. Those with complications should pursue weight loss until their BMI is at or below the 85th percentile. The general recommendation is about one pound per month. For overweight children over 7 years old, weight loss is recommended to achieve a BMI at or below the 85th percentile.

### Elevated Cholesterol

-   Diagnosis\
    The guideline for normal cholesterol is less than 170 mg/dl for total cholesterol and the goal LDL level is less than 130 mg/dl.

-   Management\
    Elevated cholesterol in children is a worsening problem, and the experts are still figuring out what is the best way of treating it.

    -   Children with a family history of high cholesterol or who are overweight or obese should have cholesterol checked.

    -   For children who have elevated cholesterol, the recommendation is to work on diet and exercise including referral to dietician.

    -   If LDL is greater than 190 mg/dl, initial recommendation is six months of diet and exercise treatment. If there is no improvement after six months and child is age 10 or older recommendation is to start treatment with a statin in discussion with the family. These children with LDL of greater than 190mg/dl it is likely they have a familial hypercholesterolemia and should be referred to a pediatric lipid specialist.

    -   For children who have other cardiac risk factors(ie. hypertension, Diabetes mellitus Type 1 or 2, Kawasaki disease) or family risk factors including cardiac event in male parent, grandparent, uncle less than age 55 or female parent, grandparent, aunt less than age 65 the decision could be made to initiate therapy at a lower LDL range.
