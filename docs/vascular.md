# Vascular

## Foundation

### Investigations

- Ankle-brachial index measurements are performed to evaluate peripheral vascular disease (PVD). PVD presents with leg and buttock pain that are worse with activity and relieved by rest. On the other hand, the pain of spinal stenosis is posture-dependent, persisting when standing but improving when walking uphill. Furthermore, this patient has 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.

## Vasculitis

### Giant cell arteritis 

present with jaw pain exacerbated by eating. However, pain due to jaw claudication would worsen during chewing and improve shortly after cessation. In addition, pain would not resolve with antibiotic treatment, and a tender submandibular mass would not be present.



## Carotid Artery Disease

### Carotid Artery Stenosis



## Aortic Conditions

### Aortic Dissection

- Aortic dissection occurs due to an aortic intimal tear, intramural haematoma, or separation of the tunica media creating a false lumen. Propagation of the dissection from the initial tear accounts for the varied clinical manifestations.

- **Predisposing factors** include patients with 

  - hypertension, smoking, atherosclerosis, 
  - pregnant patients, 
  - patients with disorders of collagen, or vasculitis (giant cell arteritis or Marfan's syndrome).

- Two primary types of classifications are in use: the DeBakey and Stanford classifications.

  - The **DeBakey system** is divided into 3 types:

    - Type I involves the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and the descending aorta.
    - Type II involves the ascending aorta, but does not extend beyond the left subclavian artery.
    - Type III involves only the descending aorta, starting at, or distal to, the left subclavian artery.

  - The **Stanford** system is divided into two groups:

    - Type A involves the ascending aorta (with or without involvement of the descending aorta). 
    - Type B involves only the descending aorta.

    The Stanford classification is simpler and it helps to delineate treatment (see below).

**Clinical Features**

Consider the diagnosis of aortic dissection in any patient with the following:

1. Sudden, severe, tearing chest pain/upper abdominal pain radiating to the back, **maximal at the outset**. Patient may feel unbearable agony, and fall to the ground or pace restlessly.
2. **Migratory pain** from the chest to the abdomen to the lower limbs **(ILEAD,** i.e. lschaemia of the Lower Extremities due to Aortic Dissection). As a rule, the pain of acute myocardial infarction (MI) is *not* migratory, and when the two occur together, the dissection typically begins first and leads to the MI
3. Chest pain **with associated neurological symptoms**, syncope, transient ischaemic attack, stroke, or paraplegia.
4. Chest pain with **increased risk** of aortic dissection, e.g. hypertension, Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and pregnancy.
5. **Pulse deficits or difference** in systolic blood pressure in both arms (>20 mmHg) or blood pressure in the upper limbs is greater than in the lower limbs.
6. Chest pain with **new onset aortic regurgitation murmur**.
7. Chest pain with **widened mediastinum** of >8 cm on the posceroamerior chest X-ray.
8. Myocardial infarction is usually due to inferior MI because of lesions in the right coronary artery affecting the coronary ostia (1-7%).

- Most patients with acute aortic dissection present with significant hypertension. A small percentage **will** present with hypotension from aortic rupture into the pleural space or into the pericardium with subsequent tamponade

**Diagnosis**

- **Diagnoses** chat may be **confused** with **thoracic aortic dissection** include the following: 
  - Stroke
  - Myocardial infarction or unstable angina, pericardia! disease.
  - Pneumonia
  - Abdominal disease
  - Lower extremity ischaemic thrombosis. 

**Management**

The goal of **treatment** is to prevent death and irreversible end-organ damage. The **aim of medical therapy** is to lower the rate of rise of blood pressure (dP/dT) and to lower the mean blood pressure and heart rate.

- Monitoring
  - Monitor the vital signs (including cardiac activity) m the critical care area.
- Investigation
  - Labs
    - FBC, coagulation profile
    - GXM 4 to  6 units of packed cells, if hypotensive, two units rapid match blood as well
    - Cardiac enzymes
    - Urea/electrolyte /creatinine
  - Electrophys: ECG
  - Imaging: 
    - **CXR**
      - The screening upright chest X-ray will be abnormal in 80-90% of cases of aortic dissection. However, a normal chest X-ray does *not* exclude the diagnosis.
      -  Widened superior mediastinum {>8 cm on a posteroanterior film; most common, i.e. 75% of chest X-rays).
      - Extension of aortic shadow more than 5 mm beyond its calcified wall ('eggshell' or 'calcium' sign; this is due to the acute dissection separating the adventitia and the calcified intima; the most specific physical sign of aortic dissection although not common).
      - Obliteration of the aortic knob or localized bulge.
      - Aortic enlargement.
      - Double density of the aorta (false lumen is less radiopaque). 
      - Loss of space between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. 
      - Widening of the paravertebral stripe.
      - New pleural effusion (free haemothorax).
      - Apical pleural cap (localized apical haemothorax).
      - Depression of the left main stem bronchus to more than 140°.
      - Shift and elevation of the right main stem bronchus.
      - Deviation of the trachea/endotracheal/nasogastric tube to the right (away from the developing haematoma).
    - Bedside **2-D echocardiography** can be done to look for widened aortic root of >3cm in proxima\ aortic dissection
    - Bedside **transoesophageal echocardiography** **(TEE)** is the definitive diagnostic study of choice in aortic dissection in an unstable patient.
    - Arrange for **CT** **aortogram** once diagnosis is suspected.
  - Insert a **urinary catheter** to monitor the urine output and to exclude anuria/oliguria suggesting possible involvement of both renal arteries.
- Treatment
  - Supportive
    - Give high flow supplemental oxygen.
    - Set up 2 large bore IV lines. 
    - Give **pain relief** with IV morphine 2.5-5.0 mg titrated to clinical need.
  - Medical
    - IV **labetalol:** Initial treatment with IV beta blocker helps reduce the heart rate to below 60. beats per minute. The fall in both blood pressure and rate of rise of systolic pressure will minimize aortic wall stress.
      -  IV **labetalol** may be more readily accessible and is a good alternative as it produces both alpha-adrenergic (a-adrenergic) and beca-adrenergic (~-adrencrgic) blocks. Make up a solution of 1 mg/ml by diluting 50 mg (10 ml) to 40 ml normal saline or 5% dextrose solution. Start infusion at 2 mg/min titrated up to 8 mg/min every 15 minutes as necessary. Alternatively, for more rapid control of blood pressure, give IV labetalol 20 mg bolus over 2 minutes initially followed by repeat or double doses every IO minutes until the target heart rate is reached or a maximum of 150 mg has been given, then start continuous infusion at 2 mg/min titrated up to 8 mg/min.
      - Although labetalol is a combined alpha and beta blocker, it is actually 7x more of a beta blocker for all intents and purposes, and the provider should always be prepared to add nitroprusside because labetalol is usually insufficient when used as a single agent
      - IV **propranolol** can also be used.
      - IV **esmolol** may be preferable in the acute setting due to its short half-life and ability to be titrated to effect. However, cost and availability is an issue.
    - IV **nitroprusside infusion plus** IV **propranolol**
      - Make a solution of 100 μg/ml nitroprusside by adding 50 mg co 500 ml 5% dextrose. **Start infusion at 6 ml/hr (10 μg/min) and increase it by steps of 10 μg/min every 5 minutes** as necessary, and give IV propranolol 1 mg every 5 minutes until a target heart rate of 60-80 beats per minute is achieved (give **before** or **simultaneously** with nitroprusside as nitroprusside may produce reflex tachycardia).
    - If hypotensive, start IV fluid resuscitation. 
    - Treatment for cardiac tamponade not responding to fluid resuscitation is immediate pericardiocentesis. Inotropic agents should be avoided since they will increase aortic shear stress and worsen the dissection.
    - Patients with documented aortic dissection who are **normotensive** or have no pain should still be treated with a medical regimen. Further decreases of their blood pressure and heart race to the aforementioned ranges are unlikely to cause harm and will help stop progression of the dissection in the same manner as in hypertensive patients.
  - Surgical
    - Contact the cardiochoracic surgeon as soon as diagnosis is suspected and while medical therapy is being instituted.
    - The **indications for surgical repair** of aortic dissection include:
      1. All Stanford type A dissections.
      2. Type B dissections with complications (rupture, severe distal ischaemia, intractable pain, progression, and uncontrolled hypertension). Otherwise, type B dissections can be managed medically.
      3. Uncontrolled hypertension.
      4. Progression of dissection.

**Other Notes**

- Remember chat acute aortic dissection is 2 to 3 times more common than ruptured abdominal aneurysm, and the misdiagnosis rate is as high as 90%. Furthermore, the mortality of untreated type A dissection is 1% per hour in the first 48 hours.

### Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

Aneurysm is a localized dilatation of an artery of >50% of the normal diameter. Most aortic aneurysms are associated with **atherosclerosis**, while ocher common aetiologies include **cystic medial necrosis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and dissection**.

- A dilatation of <50% of the normal arterial diameter is termed *ectasia.*

- Epidemiology
  - Occurs in 5-7% people over 60 years old.
  - In Singapore, the male:female ratio approximates 2:1, with an apparent lower incidence m Indians.

**Risk Factors**

-  Hypertension: seen in at least 40% of AAAs.
- Smoking: 8 times greater likelihood of having AAA compared with non-smokers. 
- Hyperlipidaemia and hyperhomocysteinaemia.

**Presentation**

The majority of AAA (75%) are asymptomatic, the rest can present as 

- Catastrophic intraperitoneal **rupture** causing collapse, shock and death. Most have a sentinel bleed into retroperironeum, which then ruptures intraperitoneally.
- Abdominal, flank or back **pain** (sometimes mimicking ureteric colic).
  - The back pain could be either due to the expansion of the AAA with erosion of the spinal vertebrae or it could represent rupture of the aneurysm, which is a surgical emergency.
- Abdominal **mass**, often pulsatile, but occasionally not.
- **Syncope** with postural hypotension.
- Embolization causing acute ischaemic limb or mottling of the lower trunk and extremities. Peripheral embolization could cause **blue toe syndrome.**
- Aortoenteric fistula presenting as **melaena**.
- **Compression** of the bowel, stomach or oesophagus may lead to dysphagia, early satiety, nausea and/or vomiting.

**Diagnosis**

- Diffuse and non-specific nature of a symptomatic AAA may lead to errors in diagnosis. Any elderly patient presenting with hypotension, shock and back pain must have a ruptured AAA excluded. Most diagnostic **errors** are due to the **failure to palpate pulsatile mass.**
  
- Look for **expansile versus transmitted pulsation** by placing fingers alongside pulsation; deviation of the fingers laterally is due to aneurysm.
  
- All patients with a pulsatile mass **>3 cm** should have an **ultrasound** evaluation.

- Risk of rupture

  Aortic aneurysms have an exponential expansion rate and the risk of rupture is proportional to the diameter of the aneurysm:

  - Aneurysms 4 - 5.5 cm diameter have 5% risk of rupture 
  - Aneurysms 6 - 7 cm have 33% risk of rupture
  - Aneurysms >7 cm have 95% risk of rupture

  Some studies suggest hypertension and COLD are strong predictors of rupture in small aneurysms.

**Prognosis**

Mortality rate from emergency surgery is 75-90%, whereas it is only 3-5% in an elective repair.

**Management**

- Supportive
  - Manage patient in the critical care area.
  - Intubation and resuscitation equipment must be immediately available.
  - Inform appropriate surgical team stat according to local protocols.
  - ABC primary survey, ensure patent airway and perform resuscitative measures as needed.
  - Establish at least 2 large-bore IV lines with **normal saline** as infusate bur **do not** over-resuscitate patient. Permit hypotension of 90-100 mm Hg systolic.
  - Place urinary catheter.
  - Do not allow repeated abdominal palpation once diagnosed.
- Monitor 
  - ECG, vital signs, pulse oximetry.
- Investigations
  - Labs
    - GXM 6 units whole blood (order group-specific blood as necessary if delay in full cross-match) FBC, coagulation profile
    - ABG
    - urea/electrolytes/creatinine
  - Imaging
    - Portable CXR (look for dissection/mediastinal widening).
    - **Plain abdominal films** will show calcification in approximately 50% of cases, but needs to be seen in both lateral and AP films to diagnose an AAA. If the classical 'egg-shell' appearance is present, the degree of confidence in diagnosis is high. A negative plain x-ray does not exclude the diagnosis of AAA and limits the value of this study.
    - **Bedside ultrasound** is useful in the ED co diagnose the presence of an aneurysm bur is operator-dependent. Ir may nor derect a conrained rupture. An aortic diameter of >3cm suggests the possibility of AAA. Use B mode. 
      - AAA > 5 cm diameter require elective surgery
      - Smaller AAA should be monitored by regular ultrasound measurements
    - Ruptured AAA is a surgical emergency and the patient muse be prepared for operation as soon as possible. There is no place for routine abdominal or CT films. However, if patient is **stable,** then **CT scan** has become the investigation of choice with regard to the diagnosis of AAA, bur **must not delay definitive treatment** of a ruptured or leaking AAA.



### Coarctation of the Aorta

Assuming sufficient severity of the coarctation, symptoms include chest pain, cold lower extremities, dizziness, syncope, exercise intolerance, failure to thrive, poor growth, headache, and dyspnea, among others. Distal to the coarctation, pulses will be diminished. Blood pressure will be lower in the lower extremities compared to the upper extremities. Murmurs may also be heart on auscultation. Coarctation of the aorta may also be associated with other congenital heart defects (bicuspid aortic valve in 50



## Peripheral Vascular Disease

Patients with diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia is at high risk for peripheral vascular disease (PVD), which can be evaluated by angiography.  Initial testing for PVD usually consists of non-invasive studies (eg, ankle-brachial index testing). Management include possible stents.

**Caution** Priority should be given to ruling out osteomyelitis before treating PVD in patients with diabetes foot ulcer.

### Acute Limb Ischaemia

Acute limb ischaemia is defined as a sudden decrease in limb perfusion. 

- Limb viability may be threatened, typically within 2 weeks from the acute event.
- There is a window of approximately 6 hours before irreversible neuromuscular damage to a limb occurs
- The amputation rate is 6 - 20% whereas mortality is 6 - 12%
- Always consider limb ischemia as a cause of limb pain or neurological deficit

**Causes**

- Thrombosis: vascular grafts, thrombosis of aneurysm, hyper-coagulable state, low flow state
  - lschaemia from arterial **thrombosis** in underlying atherosclerosis is usually less severe than that following acute embolus. This is due to collateral circulation that has developed over time.
- Embolus: 80% are cardiac (AFib, AMI, endocarditis, prosthetic values), arterial (aneurysms)
  - Emboli are typically lodged in an acute narrowing of the artery, e.g. atherosclerotic plaques and at the bifurcation points of blood vessels.
- Arterial Trauma: blunt or penetrating 
  - Arterial **trauma** can be from iatrogenic causes (vascular/cardiac diagnostic and interventional procedures). Intimal flaps and dissection are frequently the cause of occlusion.

**Clinical Feature**

- 6 Ps of acute limb ischemia
  - **Pain**: Sudden dramatic development consistent with embolus. Gradual increase in the symptoms consistent with chronic ischaemia.
  - **Poikilothermia**
  - **Pallor:** The level of arterial obstruction is usually one joint above the line of demarcation between the normal and ischaemic tissue.
  - **Pulselessness**: Presence of pulse deficit in the asymptomatic *contralateral* extremity indicative of underlying chronic arterial occlusive disease. Conversely, the presence of a strong pulse in the asymptomatic contralateral extremity indicates that the underlying occlusion is acute.
  - **Paraesthesia:** Subjective sensory deficits suggest early nerve dysfunction. The anterior compartment of the lower leg is most sensitive to ischaemia. Sensory deficits over the dorsum of the foot are often the earliest neurologic sign of vascular insufficiency.
  -  **Paralysis**
- In addition, the **'blue-toe syndrome'** can occur from small vessel occlusion: Appearance of a cool, painful, cyanotic toe, or forefoot in the presence of strong pedal pulses and a warm foot.
- Physical Examination looking for
  - Atrial fibrillation
  - Signs of chronic peripheral vascular disease (suggestive of thrombotic etiology)
    - Shiny hyper pigmentation of the skin
    - Hair loss
    - Muscle atrophy
    - Skin ulceration
  - Sensation and motor control
  - All peripheral pulses (use Doppler if not palpable)

**Classification** 

| Class                  | Remark                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Viable                 | No sensory loss or muscle weakness                           |
| Marginally threatened  | Salvageable if treated promptly, minimal sensory loss (more distally), no muscle weakness, and arterial Doppler inaudible |
| Immediately threatened | Salvageable with immediate revascularization, sensory loss more proximal, rest pain, mild to moderate muscle weakness and arterial Doppler inaudible |
| Irreversible           | Sensory loss and muscle weakness profound, possible rigorous, arterial and venous Doppler signals inaudible. Require amputation |

**Management**

For emergency management

- Supportive
  - Put patient in an monitored area
  - Put patient in dependent position
  - Avoid extremes of temperature
  - Refer to vascular surgeon immediately
- Symptomatic medication
  - Aspirin and Unfractionated heparin (IV then continuous infusion)
  - Provide analgesia
  - Provide oxygen
- Investigation
  - Perform ECG to look for atrial fibrillation
  - FBC, Blood type, coagulation panel + renal panel
  - Imaging
    - Use digital subtraction **angiography** as the gold standard for acute limb ischaemia (benefit of concurrently diagnosing and treating occlusion).
    - OR **duplex ultrasonography** if the patient is allergic to contrast agents or at high risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.
    - OR perform **computed tomography/magnetic resonance angiography** if an equivocal examination and no immediate intervention are needed.

For definitive treatment by surgeons

- **Endovascular intervention:** Intra-arterial thrombolysis and percutaneous thrombectomy
- **Surgery:** Open thrombectomy and bypass grafting
- Patients with non-viable extremities should undergo prompt amputation without imaging to reduce risk of infection, myoglobinuria, acute renal failure, hyperkalaemia, multi-organ failure, and cardiovascular collapse.

## Venous Conditions

### Venous Ulcers

### Varicose Veins

### Venous Insufficiency

### Superficial Thrombophlebitis

This is a venous emergency.

- This is due to inflammation, infection, and/or thrombosis in a superficial vein.

- Superficial thrombophlebitis of the **lower extremity** may progress to deep vein or deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and subsequently pulmonary embolism if left untreated especially in deep proximal lower limb veins
  - The **superficial femoral vein** is a **deep vein** and evidence of thrombophlebitis in it will require treatment for DVT.
- Suspect **IV drug abuse** in thrombophlebitis affecting unusual sites especially in the presence of multiple hyperpigmented sites over the limbs.

**Risk Factors**

- Disruption in Virchow's triad.

- Infection (bacterial pathogens: *Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacte- riaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococci*

- IV cannulation (patient with burns or are immuno-compromised).
- IV drug abuse (especially intravenous buprenorphine and midazolam locally).
- Use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy.
- IV medications **(potassium chloride, calcium chloride/gluconate,** and hypertonic solutions, e.g. **dextrose 50%).**

**Clinical Features**

- Tenderness, pain and erythema along a superficiavlein.

- Palpable **cord** with warmth and surrounding erythema.
- Suspicion of a thrombus arises when the palpable cord persists after lifting the limb against gravity.
- Low grade **fever** may accompany an uncomplicated superficial phlebitis but a high fever and the presence of **purulent** discharge suggest a **septic thrombophlebitis.**
- A cord may be palpable for weeks to months after an episode of superficial phlebitis.

**Management**

- Remove the IV cannula if thrombophlebitis occurs in the setting of an IV catheter.

- Treat uncomplicated superficial phlebitis with heat, elevation, and NSAIDs. Compression stockings are also useful.
- The use of **low molecular weight heparin** has been advocated by some for lower extremity superficial thrombophlebitis.
- Administer **IV antibiotics** (from another IV site) if there are signs of infection e.g. cellulitis,  suppurative thrombophlebitis.

### Venous Thrombosis

Common risk factors of venous thrombosis broadly fit Virchow's Triad of venous stasis, injury to endothelium, and enhance coagulability:

| Factor                    | Examples                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Flow stasis               | Prolonged immobilization due to long journeys, a stroke, etc. <br />Major trauma or surgery within 4 weeks  <br />Congestive heart failure  <br />Obesity<br />Advanced age <br />Spinal cord injuries <br />Shock syndromes |
| Endothelial Damage        | Local trauma<br/>Surgery of legs and pelvis<br/>Vasculitis<br/>Burns<br/>Electric shock<br/>Infection<br/>Previous history of thromboembolism |
| Coagulation Abnormalities | Polycythaemia<br/>Platelet ·abnormalities<br/>Oral contraceptive drugs with high estrogen content <br />Malignant neoplasia<br/>Deficiency of antithrombin Ill, protein C or S |

*NOTE:* The identification of risk factors not only aids in the clinical diagnosis of venous thromboembolism, but also guides decisions about prophylactic measures and repeat resting in borderline cases

#### Cavernous sinus thrombosis 

This is a venous emergency.

Characterized by proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, chemosis, and visual loss.  It occurs due to hematogenous spread from an infected, inflamed sinus.

#### Deep Vein Thrombosis

This is a venous emergency. 

DVT is usually unilateral unless vena cava occludes, which is rare but catastrophic. Phlegmasia cerulean dolens is an uncommon form of massive proximal venous thrombosis of the lower extremities and carries a high morbidity often leading to circulatory collapse and shock.

There may not necessarily be a correlation between the location of symptoms and the site of thrombosis in patients with DVT, therefore a high index of suspicion is required especially in patients with risk factors for developing DVT.

- age, obesity, inactivity
- medical conditions such as heart failure, cancer
- history of thrombosis

**Clinical Feature**

1. **Oedema**, principally **unilateral.**

   - Fullness of the lower limb that increases with standing or walking.

   - A lack of discrepancy in calf size does not rule out DVT. However, **asymmetric calf swelling**

     **of** **>3** **cm** is almost always a significant finding in DVT.

2. **Leg pain** occurs in 50% of patients, but this is entirely non-specific.

   - Pain in the lower extremities on coughing or sneezing which is different from the electric- type pain with cough or sneeze associated with sciatica.
   - DVT usually occurs over several days, a sudden, severe pain is more likely due to muscle strain / tear or a popliteal (Baker's) cyst rupture.
   - **Tenderness** occurs in 75% of patients but is also found in 50% of patients without objectively confirmed DVT.
   - **Homan's sign** (pain in the posterior calf or knee on forced dorsiflexion of the foot)

3. The affected limb is often **warmer** than the normal side.

4. **Palpable 'cords'** which are very specific, although insensitive for thrombosis.

5. Not associated with high fever; DVT is unlikely if body temperature is >39 degree celsius

**Diagnosis**

- **Clinical prediction rules for** **DVT:** 
  - **Modified Wells** and Hamilton scores have similar performance characteristics.
- Investigate
  - **Compression ultrasonography** is the preferred initial test for diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).  
  - A **D-dimer** test can be used to rule our DVT (the D-dimer has a sensitivity of ~98.5% for proximal DVTs).
    - Causes of **false positive results** include **infection, malignancy,** recent **surgery,** and **trauma.** Thus, while a **negative result** is useful in **ruling out venous thromboembolism,** a positive result is not useful for confirming the diagnosis.
    - False negative results may occasionally arise, and the level of clinical suspicion must be taken into account when evaluating the test result.

**Management**

More than 95% of pulmonary emboli arise from thrombi in the deep venous system of the lower extremities. Ninety percent of deaths due to pulmonary embolism result within an hour or two -- before diagnostic and therapeutic plans can be implemented. Therefore, prevention and prompt treatment of DVT is the most effective approach to prevention of, and death due to, embolism.

- The goals of management of DVT therefore are
  - Immediate inhibition of the growth of thromboemboli
  - Promotion of thromboembolic resolution
  - Prevention of recurrence

- Disposition

  - Most patients with DVT may be managed in the out-patient setting, though there are a few important exceptions
    - In order to treat DVT on an outpatient basis, the patient must be:
      -   Hemodynamically stable
      -   With good kidney function
      -   At low risk for bleeding
    - The home environment must be:
      -   Stable and supportive
      -   Capable of providing the patient with daily access to INR monitoring (if using warfarin as the anticoagulant)
  - For many years, the standard of care for DVT was admission to the hospital and administration of unfractionated heparin overlapping with the initiation of warfarin. Inpatient management remains the best option for patients who are hemodynamically unstable, who are at serious risk of acute bleeding with the initiation of anticoagulation (e.g. those with prior admission for gastrointestinal bleeding), or who have obstacles to outpatient management. Examples of this include the inability to afford NOACs and LMWH, or inability to get daily INRs checked during the initiation of warfarin therapy

- **Pharmacological Therapy of DVT**

  - Anti-coagulant therapy is indicated for patients with symptomatic proximal DVT as pulmonary embolism will occur in about 50% of untreated patients within days or weeks of the event.
    - IV **heparin** 80 U/kg bolus followed by 18 U/kg/hr maintenance infusion
    - **Lower molecular weight heparin** (e.g. SC enoxaparin 0.1 mg/kg bd)
    - SC fondaparinux (inhibits factor Xa)

  The American College of Chest Physicians recently recommended the choice of **factor Xa inhibitors** or the **direct thrombin inhibitor** dabigatran (collectively referred to as non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants or NOACs) over warfarin for the management of DVT or PE.

  - Two oral factor Xa inhibitors (**rivaroxaban** and **apixaban**) have been demonstrated to be safe as monotherapy for DVT. These agents have been shown to have similar efficacy to warfarin in preventing PE, but have been demonstrated to cause fewer bleeding episodes than warfarin. Advantages include that they do not require any laboratory monitoring, so they are much easier for patients to take. Disadvantages include their cost (compared to warfarin, which is very inexpensive) and the unavailability of immediate reversal agents in the case of dangerous bleeding. 
  - The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran is another option for oral anticoagulation that has similar advantages to rivaroxaban and apixaban. It has not been studied as monotherapy however (option E), so it is recommended that patients be initiated on LMWH with five to 10 days of overlap.

  Before the development of the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), warfarin was the mainstay of the management of DVT. It remains an acceptable option and remains commonly used in many settings. Warfarin is a better option for patients who can't afford the cost of the NOACs and who are concerned about the lack of reversal agents. Warfarin takes several days to reach therapeutic efficacy, so simply starting it alone carries an unacceptable risk of PE. Thus, patients must be started on either LMWH or unfractionated heparin while waiting for the patient's INR to come into the therapeutic range. LMWH is the preferred anticoagulant to pair with warfarin in most settings, and may be administered in the outpatient setting.

  Finally, The duration of anticoagulation depends on whether the patient has a first episode of DVT, ongoing risk factors for venous thromboembolic disease, and known thrombophilia. If these are absent, **treat for 3 months**, if present, indefinitely.

  

- Other Treatment

  - Consulcation with the incervencional radiologist for catheter-directed intrathrombus thrombolysis in patients with ileofemoral DVT.
  - Thrombectomy is reserved for patients with massive ileofemoral vein thrombosis with vascular compromise when thrombolysis is contraindicated.

#### Pulmonary Embolism

Thrombotic pulmonary embolism (PE) is not an isolated disease of the chest but a complication of venous thrombosis. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE are therefore part of the same process, venous thromboembolism.

- Leg DVT is found in 70% of patients with PE. Conversely, PE occurs in 50% of patients with proximal DVT of the legs (involving popliteal and/or more proximal veins), and is less likely when the thrombus is confined to the calf veins.
- As PE is preceded by DVT, the **factors predisposing** to the two conditions are the same and broadly fit Virchow's triad of venous stases, injury to the vein wall, and enhanced coagulability of the blood. 
- Note that venous PE here is different from post-op PE in surgery
  - In **surgical series,** the risk of venous thromboembolism rises rapidly with age, length of anaesthesia and the presence of previous venous thromboembolism, or cancer. The incidence is highest in those undergoing emergency surgery (e.g. for hip fractures) following trauma and pelvic surgery. 
  - In **medical series,** venous thromboembolism is frequent in patients with cardiorespiratory disorders (e.g. congestive heart failure and irreversible airways disease), leg immobility (caused by stroke and other neurological disease), and cancer

**Clinical Features**

1. Nearly all patients with PE will have **one or more** of the following **clinical features:** 
   - Sudden onset dyspnea
   - Tachypnoea (>20 breaths/minute)
   - Chest pain (pleuritic or substernal)
2. Likelihood increases when above clinical features are associated with
   - Signs of right ventricular strain: 
     - Jugular venous distension on physical examination
     - Right bundle branch block (RBBB) on electrocardiogram (ECG) - RSR or M-shaped QRS complex, wide slurred S in lead I, and T wave inversion in V1-3
   - radiologic signs of plump hilum
   - pulmonary infarction
   - oligaemia
3. PE patients
   - Are rarely NOT hypoxic
   - Typically have NO hypercapnia
   - Not orthopnoeic

| ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Acute, minor      | Short, sudden onset | <50%                 | Dyspnea with or without pleuritic pain and haemoptysis       |
| Acute, massive    | Short, sudden onset | >50%                 | Right heart strain with or without haemodynamic instability and syncope |
| Subacute, massive | Several weeks       | >50%                 | Dyspnea with right heart strain                              |

- Minor acute: anticoagulate and then work up cause - provoked vs spontaneous
  - Spontaneous might need longer duration prophylaxis
- Acute massive: thrombolysis or embolectomy asap; early discussion with interventionist
  - Off load right heart asap
- Submassive / acute massive: resuscitate dry
  - 10 ml/kg is conservative fluid bolus
  - 200 / 250 ml challenge
  - Use bedside U/S to guide fluid resuscitation? CVP pressure reading.IVC diameters need to be interpreted within the context of

**Management**

- Initial management in **suspected PE**

  - Investigate

    - ECG

      - ECG changes are usually non-specific. Its main value is to exclude other potential diagnoses, such as MI or pericarditis.
      - Minor PE: only sinus tachycardia, without haemodynamic stress

      - ECG changes are usually non-specific. Its main value is to exclude other potential diagnoses, such as MI or pericarditis.
      - The commonest ECG change is **T-wave inversion** in the anteroseptal and inferior leads found in 68% of patients with PE. The number of inverted T-waves in the anterior and inferior distribution increase with seventy of right heart strain, cor pulmonale, and resulting sub-epicardial ischaemia, and predicts early complication from PE. Reversal of T-wave **before the 6th day** is associated with a more favourable outcome.
      - In acute or subacute massive PE, evidence of **right heart strain** may be seen:
        1. Rightward shift of the QRS axis.
        2. Transient right bundle branch block.
        3. T-wave inversion in leads V1-3
        4. P pulmonale: P-wave will display higher amplitude in lead II and lead V1
        5. Classical S1Q3T3 (only present in 12% of massive PE)
      - Normal ECG in 6% of massive PE.

    - Labs: 

      - **Arterial blood** **gas:** The characteristic changes are a **reduced PaO2** and a PaCO2 **that is normal or reduced** because of hyperventilation. The Pa0, is almost never normal in massive PE bur can be normal in minor PE, mainly due to hyperventilation. In such cases, the widening of the alveolo-arterial PO2 gradient (AaPO2 >20 mmHg) may be more sensitive than Pa0 alone. Both hypoxaemia and a wide AaP02 may obviously be due to many other causes. Blood gases, therefore, may heighten the suspicion of PE, but are of insufficient discriminant value to permit proof or exclusion of PE. Note the patient's fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi0z> at the time of blood sampling.
      - Do **D-dimer** ELISA test if pre-test probability is low to rule out PE. 
        - It has a sensitivity of 85-94% for diagnosing pulmonary embolism. However, its specificity is only 67-68%. A normal D-dimer ELISA rest result is useful in excluding PE in patients with a low pretest probability of PE or a non-diagnostic lung scan. However, an abnormal result (however high) does not imply significantly increased probability of PE.
      - Full blood count, GXM 4 to 6 units of packed red blood cells
      - Urea/ electrolytes/ creatinine

    - Imaging

      - **Chest X-ray** findings in PE:
        - In general, the chest X-ray (CXR) is not specific or diagnostic in PE, but comparison with previous films may be helpful.
        - The main benefit of CXR is to rule out other conditions mimicking PE (e.g. pneumothorax, pneumonia, left heart failure, tumour, rib fracture, massive pleural effusion, and lobar collapse), but PE may coexist with other cardiopulmonary processes.
        - The **findings** may show the following: 
          - Normal CXR (~40%):  normal film is compatible with all types of acute PE. In fact, a normal film in a patient with severe acute dyspnoea without wheezing is very suspicious of PE.
          - **Fleischner sign** (distended central pulmonary artery due to the presence of a large clot)
          - Evidence of pulmonary infarction: Peripheral opacities, sometimes wedge-shaped with the apex pointing towards the hilum or semicircular, with its base against the pleural surface **(Hampton's hump).**
          - Focal pulmonary oligaemia in the parts of the lung affected by emboli **(Westennark sign)** but this is difficult to diagnose on the type of film usually available in the acute s1tuat1on.
          - Other low specificity observations:
            - Long bands of focal atelectasis seen in pulmonary infarction **(Fleischner lines).**
            - Small pleural effusions.
            - Raised hemidiaphragm.
            - Localized infiltrate
            - Consolidation
      - **Venous Compression Ultrasonography (CUS)**
        - CUS of the lower extremities is another diagnostic cool utilized to increase or decrease suspicion for PE in certain situations.
        - Single CUS had a sensitivity of only 54%, a specificity of 97. A **single CUS should not be used lo rule out PE,** particularly when the test results are discordant with the clinical assessment of risk. For these reasons, follow-up CUS examinations are obtained approximately **5 co 7 days later** to **assess for clot progression**.
      - **Bedside Cardiac Echocardiography**
        - Focused bedside cardiac echocardiography is becoming an important tool in the assessment of the patient with possible PE.
        - Used to detect right ventricle dilation, reduced function or contractility, which is associated with higher in-hospital mortality. These are also one of the best predictors of poor early outcome.
        - It helps us prioritize further testing, assess the differential diagnosis, and assist with treatment decisions for haemodynamically significant emboli in the severely compromised patient.
        - In patients with haemodynamically significant pulmonary embolus, the left ventricle can be underfilled and hyperdynamic.

    - Definitive Investigations

      - **Computed Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA)**
        - CTPA has become the primary radiologic study ordered for evaluation of PE.
        - Although CTPA alone does detect the majority of PE, it is not sensitive enough to detect all subsegmental PE. However, subsegmental PE does not confer the same risk to the patient as larger clots.
        - The main **advantage** of PE is that the imaging of lung parenchyma and great vessels is possible (e.g. pulmonary mass, pneumonia, emphysema, pleural effusion, and mediastinal adenopathy) and diagnosis can be made if PE is absent. Hence, CTPA can help in diagnosing **alternative causes of dyspnoea**. CTPA can also detect right ventricular dilatation, thus indicating severe, potentially fatal PE.
        - Main disadvantages of CTPA.
          - Exposure to radiation of 15 mSv (equivalent to approx. 150 2-view CXRS) 
          - Adverse reactions to iodinated intravenous contrast media:
            - anaphylaxis or other systemic allergic reaction.
            - contrast-induced nephropathy
      - **Lung scintigraphy**
        - A normal perfusion scan essentially excludes the diagnosis of a clinically relevant recent PE because occlusive PE of all types produces a defect of perfusion.
        - However, many conditions other than PE, such as tumours, consolidation, left heart failure, bullous lesions, lung fibrosis, and obstructive airway disease, can also produce perfusion defects.
        - PE usually produces a defect of perfusion but not ventilation ('mismatch') while most of the other conditions produce a ventilation defect in the same area as the perfusion defect (matched defects).
        - The probability that perfusion defects are caused by PE can be assessed as high, intermediate, or low depending on the type of scan abnormality 

  - **Start IV heparin 5000 U** bolus or **SC fraxiparine** 0.4 ml for patients weighing less than 50 kg, 0.5 ml for those weighing between 50 and 60 kg, and 0.6 ml for those heavier than 65 kg.

  - Contact the general medical or respiratory medical registrar and admit patient to respiratory medicine

- Initial management in **massive PE** with signs of haemodynamic instability:

  - Monitor the patient's vital signs in the critical care area.
  - Give **oxygen** via a non-rebreather mask or intubate if unable to maintain oxygenation
    - Note that Intubation may cause the haemodynamic situation to deteriorate further by impeding venous return.
  - Set up 2 **large bore intravenous** (IV) **lines** 
    - When thrombolytic treatment is considered, the antecubital route should be preferred and insertion of arterial lines avoided
  - Send blood for investigation. 
  - Start Fluid resuscitation.
  - lf blood pressure is still low despite fluid resuscitations, start **inotropes.**
    - Inotropes may do no more than precipitate dysrhythmias when the cardiac output is reduced, the dilated right ventricle is hypoxic and already near maximal stimulation from the high concentration of endogenous catecholamines. The judicious use of **IV noradrenaline** titrated against a moderate increase in blood pressure may be beneficial.
  - Provide pain relief
    - Opiates should be used with caution in the hypotensive patient.
  - Contact the cardiothoracic registrar-on-call for admission to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.

### Superior Vena Cava Syndrome

This is the obstruction of blood flow in the superior vena cava (SVC) either from invasion or external compression of the SVC. It is a venous emergency.

**Causes**

- Malignancy (lung cancer and lymphoma account for 95% of the cases) is the most common cause of SVC syndrome.
  - In up to 60% of patients, **superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction** may be the first presentation of an underlying **malignancy**
- Thoracic aortic aneurysms.
- Iatrogenic causes (indwelling central venous devices, dialysis access, and pacemaker leads may cause thrombosis).

**Clinical Features**

- Dyspnoea, Headache and giddiness.
  - Cyanosis
- Facial swelling, especially when bending forward or lying down. 
  - Facial oedema/plethora.
- Upper limb swelling.
  - Venous distension of the neck, chest wall, and upper limbs, especially when the patient raises the upper limbs.
  - **Pemberton's manoeuvre** (patient raises both arms above the head vertically for 60 seconds, which exacerbates obstructive symptoms by decreasing the thoracic inlet area).
- Chest pain.
- Dysphagia.
  - Horner's syndrome, paralysis of the vocal cords, and paralysis of the phrenic nerve are rare.

**Investigations**

- A **CXR** will provide clues as to the cause of the obstruction if it is from an external compression. Up to 84% of CXRs are abnormal in one series.The most common findings are **mediastinal widening** and **pleural effusion.**
- Thoracic computed tomography, venography, or magnetic resonance imaging may also be used.

**Management**

Treat the underlying condition and palliate the symptoms:

- Manage the patient in the **resuscitation** area.
- Give high flow **oxygen** and with the patient in an **upright** position.
- Administer IV **dexamethasone** 4 to 8 mg stat.
- Only consider diuretics in the presence of cerebral or airway oedema as their routine use in the emergency department has not shown consistent benefit.
- Endotracheal incubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary if the patient develops signs of impending airway compromise.
- In malignant causes, the primary aim is to treat the malignant process.
- **Emergency radiotherapy** is no longer recommended except when the patient presents with **stridor** due to central airway obstruction or severe laryngeal oedema.
- Consider consultation with the vascular surgeon for iatrogenic causes of SVC syndrome for stenting.

## Syndromes

### Subclavian steal syndrome

causes exercise-induced arm pain, paresthesia, coolness, and color change. It typically affects the entire arm, not just the hands, and bilateral symptoms would be unexpected.
