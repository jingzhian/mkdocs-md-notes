Nasal Pharyngeal Conditions
---------------------------

### Allergic (chronic) Rhinitis

Nasal corticosteroids are the most effective medications for patients with allergic rhinitis. In one systematic review (1998), nasal corticosteroids improved symptoms of nasal blockage, nasal discharge, sneezing, nasal itch and post nasal drip compared to antihistamines. More recent reviews (2012 and 2017) confirm these findings and also recommend nasal corticosteroids as the initial drug of choice for patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis rather than an oral leukotriene inhibitor or a combination of nasal corticosteroid with an oral antihistamine. The 2017 guidelines do recommend a combination of nasal corticosteroid with an oral antihistamine for patients with moderate to severe seasonal allergic rhinitis.

Similarly, a Cochrane review demonstrated that allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots) assists in controlling symptoms and decreasing medication use in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A second Cochrane review demonstrated that allergen immunotherapy is effective in improving asthma symptoms and decrease asthma medication usage.

-   Treatment

    -   All guidelines recommend maximizing treatment for allergic rhinitis, including regular use of nasal corticosteroids and, if indicated, allergen immunotherapy. There is no difference in the type, dose or delivery method of the nasal corticosteroid used.

    -   Current guidelines and a Cochrane review (2007) found that regular nasal saline irrigation is a useful adjunct in treating chronic sinusitis, though not as effective as nasal corticosteroids. A more recent Cochrane review (2016) notes that a large volume irrigation (150 mL) with hypertonic saline is more effective than placebo, \"but the quality of the evidence is low for three months and very low for six months of treatment\".

    -   There is no compelling evidence to support the use of antibiotics in patients with chronic sinusitis. The AAAAI/ACAAI Practice Parameter Update (2014) indicates that antibiotics can be used for acute exacerbations of chronic sinusitis. A Cochrane review (2016) concluded that there was \"very little evidence that systemic antibiotics are effective in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis\". A Canadian guideline recommended antibiotics for patients with chronic sinusitis only when there is pain or purulent discharge.

    -   A Cochrane review (2016) also concluded that there is little evidence to support using short-courses of oral steroids in patients with chronic sinusitis.

### Viral Rhinosinusitis (common cold)

-   Low-grade fever is common at the onset of a cold, and it does not typically return unless a complication arise

-   Thick nasal discharge (irrespective of yellow or green discoloration) is common in acute rhinosinusitis and can persist for days to weeks after the onset of a cold

-   A patient is more likely to have viral rhinosinusitis if the duration of symptoms is fewer than 10 days and the symptoms are not worsening.

### Acute Bacterial Sinusitis {#acute-sinusitis}

-   Presentation / HX

    -   Fever, headache, facial pain, maxillary toothache

    -   Mucopurulent nasal discharge

    -   Failure to respond to decongestants and failure to improve after 10 days.

    -   Initial improvement after a viral upper respiratory infection and then a reoccurrence of worsening symptoms. (double worsening sign)

-   Physical

    -   Purulent nasal secretion

    -   Abnormal transillumination of the sinuses

    -   

### Chronic Bacterial Sinusitis

-   Presentation

    -   Nasal symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks, consisting of at least 2 of the following

        -   Nasal obstruction or congestion

        -   Mucopurulent drainage (anterior, posterior, or both)

        -   Facial pain, pressure, or fullness

        -   Decreased sense of smell

### Upper Airway Cough Syndrome / Post Nasal Drip {#sssec:upper_airway_cough_syndrome}

Airway Problems
---------------

### Vocal Cord Dysfunction {#sssec:vocal-cord-dysfunction}

-   Diagnosis

    -   May have flattening of the inspiratory loop on spirometry

    -   Diagnostic finding is visualizing abnormal vocal cord movement during an episode of wheezings

### Eosinophilic Bronchitis {#sssec:eosinophilic-bronchitis}

-   Diangosis

    -   Normal spirometry, normal chest x-ray

    -   Sputum eosinophilia on induced putum or bronchial wash obtained at bronchoscopy

### Asthma {#ssec:asthma}

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that involves many cells, in particular: mast cells, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. This chronic inflammation leads to airway hyperresponsiveness and limitation of airway flow (obstruction). The persistence of inflammation can lead to airway edema. Long-term inflammation can lead to airway remodeling and permanent loss of lung function.

Long terms effects of uncontrolled asthma include

-   Airway remodelling

-   Inflammation

-   Mucous hypersecretion

-   Airway smooth muscle hypertrophy

-   Angiogenesis

-   Subepithelial fibrosis

The most concerning long-term effect is less reversibility of the airway obstruction with medication so it will be more difficult to control the patient's asthma. This is why we want to treat patients early on with appropriate medication to control symptoms and prevent all of the long-term complications.

#### Co-morbid conditions

Conditions that may require treatment to improve control of asthma

-   Obesity / Overweight

-   Stress and depression

-   Rhinitis or sinusitis

-   Obstructive sleep apnea

-   GERD

It is also important to ask about aspirin allergy, as 21% of adults who have asthma have **aspirin-induced asthma** and should avoid NSAIDs.

#### Diagnosis

Three things are needed to diagnose asthma

1.  Episodic symptoms of airflow obstruction or hyperresposiveness are present

2.  THis obstructive airflow is at least partial reversible

3.  Alternative diagnosis are excluded

Objective assessments of pulmonary function are necessary for the diagnosis of asthma because history and physical are not reliable means of excluding other diagnoses or determining the extent of lung impairment.

#### Initial Management and Evaluation

According to the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 (2007), there are four key tasks in an initial evaluation of asthma including:

1.  Classify asthma severity.

2.  Assess the patient's knowledge and skills for self-management.

3.  Identify and control environmental factors and comorbid conditions that may aggravate asthma.

4.  Offer appropriate medications.

People with asthma (as with other chronic lung conditions) should also receive pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPSV) vaccine.

Since inflammation is the primary pathologic mechanism in asthma, maintenance medication that reduces inflammation is first-line therapy.

If a patient is acutely wheezing, he or she may need quick-acting rescue medications that focus on bronchodilation and opening up the airways.

#### Asthma Medications

-   High dose inhaled corticosteroids are reserved for severe asthma as the risk of adverse effects increase with dose. Inhaled corticosteroids are well-tolerated and safe at the recommended doses. To reduce the potential adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids: spacers are recommended to reduce local side effects, patients are advised to rinse their mouths and spit after inhalation, and consider adding a long-acting beta agonist to a low- or medium-dose of inhaled corticosteroid rather than using a higher dose of corticosteroid.

-   Oral corticosteroids suppress, control, and reverse airway inflammation. However, side effects with chronic administration include among other things: osteoporosis, adrenal suppression, growth suppression, dermal thinning, hypertension, Cushing's syndrome, cataracts, increased emotional lability, psychosis, peptic ulcer disease, atherosclerosis, aseptic necrosis of the bone, diabetes mellitus, and myopathy. Every effort, then, is given to minimizing systemic corticosteroid use and maximizing other modes of therapy. When oral corticosteroids are resorted to (for quick relief of symptoms in a moderate or severe asthma exacerbation), they are given for a short duration, and side effects are monitored. Multiple courses of oral systemic corticosteroids (more than three courses annually) should prompt re-evaluation of asthma management for the patient.

-   Leukotriene receptor antagonists may be used in conjunction with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids. A Cochrane review also revealed as additions to patients already on inhaled corticosteroids, a long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler improves symptoms and lung function, while preventing exacerbations, more effectively than leukotriene receptor antagonists. A recent study suggests the efficacy of using a leukotriene-receptor antagonist as monotherapy in the treatment of asthma, however, at this time, clinical guidelines for the management of asthma have not changed.

-   Theophylline may also be used in conjunction with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids, but is not used that often due to the difficulty in titrating the theophylline dose to the correct level. A meta-analysis demonstrated that salmeterol (a long-acting beta2 agonist) inhaler led to improved lung function and more symptom-free days and nights compared to theophylline.

-   There is an emerging role of anticholinergic medication in the treatment of asthma. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis (2018) confirmed that the addition of an anticholingeric medication to an inhaled corticosteroid lowered the risk for asthma exacerbations. However, current clinical guidelines for the management of asthma do not include this medication.

-   Generally, antibiotics are not needed in acute exacerbations or in chronic management of asthma. For example, one study noted no benefit of using azithromycin in acute exacerbations of asthma . However, another study demonstrated that for patients with persistent asthma symptoms despite appropriate medications, 500 mg azithromycin three times per week for 48 weeks resulted in fewer asthma exacerbations and an improved quality of life, though diarrhea was a common side-effect.

#### Monitoring

-   Use the Asthma Action Plan

#### Example cases

-   A 40-year-old male presents to the clinic with dry cough and wheezing for the past two days. He states that his symptoms began two days ago with a headache for which he took aspirin. He denies fever, but does report some continued shortness of breath. He is a smoker but only smokes 1-2 cigarettes a day for about six months. Physical exam is negative except for bilateral wheezing and erythema on the face. What is the most likely diagnosis? Aspirin-induced asthma

-   A 15-year-old female with a history of allergic rhinitis presents to the clinic with a five day history of productive cough and wheezing that is worse at night. She denies any shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever. The patient states that she has had similar symptoms in the past, especially when seasons change. The only reported past medical history is atopic dermatitis which is well-controlled with an over-the-counter steroid cream. What is the best next step? Because the patient is symptomatic and wheezing, she needs to be treated with a medication to control her symptoms and treat her exacerbation. A short acting beta-agonist and short course of oral steroids do just that. After controlling her symptoms and treating her exacerbation, a more in-depth interview needs to be performed around the asthma symptoms and other ancillary tests need to be ordered and interpreted including a chest x-ray and pulmonary function test. Then, a decision can be made regarding daily controller inhalers (inhaled corticosteroids, chromolyn, etc).

-   An 18-year-old non-smoking male comes to the clinic with cough, chest tightness, and difficulty breathing. His past medical history is positive only for allergic rhinitis as well as an undiagnosed chronic cough primarily at night since he was 4 years old. He has no past surgical history and no recent travel. On physical exam, you notice the patient appears in mild distress, has hunched shoulders, is using accessory muscles during respiration, and is only able to talk in two to three word sentences. His vitals are: Pulse 125/min, O2 sat 88%, BP 100/70 mmHg. On auscultation, you hear wheezing on inspiration and expiration throughout both lungs. You also notice a prolonged expiratory phase. What is the most likely diagnosis? Severe Asthma Excerbation.

-   A 28-year-old male comes to the Emergency Department with shortness of breath, cough and wheezing for the last 4 hours. He states that he was diagnosed with asthma recently, and is currently using inhaled corticosteroid with a long acting B2-agonist daily to control his symptoms. His RR is 34/min; Temp: 98.8 degrees F; O2sat: 88%; BP: 130/85 mmHg. What treatment should be given to this patient first? Oxygen
