Residency Considerations
-----------------------------------

-   Specialized centers of each healthcare cluster
-   Schools affiliated with each healthcare cluster - support of Engineering students
-   Maker space
-   Support for overseas collaboration

Only if you love surgery, 

Only 1 a year?

### SingHealth Peds Surgery

Paediatic Surgery encompasses a broad range of congenital and acquired surgical diseases in babies, children, and adolescents. A speciality defined by age rather than organ system. 

- Only one that operates from head to toe
- Oncological tumors included

Example of conditions: anorectal malformation, gastrochisis, sacrococcygeal tumor

Alternative: NUHS Peds surgery 

- KKH volume is higher than NUH; 
  - NUH is the only place that one can do liver and kidney transplant

#### Program

- Don't do cardiowork

**Training outcome**

- Perform operations for paediatric and neonatal patients competently

- Actively participate in clinical research and teaching

Do much more than operating. Other talents like teaching, research, administrative skills for leading department are necessary.

#### Experience

Senior consultant: 8 am start 5 pm stop

Major OT on Friday, may go home later. 

Clinic is once a week. 

Supervision is very good, all needs to be seen by a consultant one way or another. 

Work life balance is very good. 

Department is very supportive about this.

Senior has to step down a lot. 

No more first line call. Threshold for returning to the hospital is low. 

- No subspecialization within the department
- Specialty by exclusion
  - Peds ENT
  - Peds Neurosurgery

Genetic Immunology - Amos Tan Oncology, Deputy Global Health Director

Very serious about protected teaching time and post-call.



### Integrated Neurosurgery

Feeling: too intense...hahaha...

- Dr Jai, Dr Lester Lee, Dr David Mak, Dr Felicia Chua

- Interested people: Lola Nair
- Need experience before we know if we like it or not
- Highest divorce rate is in female neurosurgeon

Case: Trauma, oncology, spine

Very demanding, more time at work (at home), as opposed to at home; expect juniors to call even after work hours, for the rest of the life.
