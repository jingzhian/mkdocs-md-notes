Wrist Problem
-------------

### Carpel Tunnel Exam

-   Physical

    -   Tinel's sign:

        -   Tap over the median nerve at the wrist to reproduce symptoms.

        -   36% sensitive and 75% specific for carpal tunnel syndrome.

    -   Phalen's test:

        -   Flex wrist by having patient place dorsal surfaces of hands together in front of her for 30 to 60 seconds to reproduce symptoms.

        -   sensitive at 57%, but less specific at 58% to 75%.

    -   Carpal Tunnel Compression (Durkan's sign):

        -   Compress the carpal tunnel for 30 seconds to reproduce symptoms.

        -   sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 83%

Back Problems
-------------

### Lumbar Strain

-   The most common cause of acute low back pain in adults

-   Typically has an acute or sub-acute onset after an injury or precipitating activity (e.g., moving furniture)

-   Pain is typically worse in the paraspinal muscles lateral to the spine and may be bilateral or unilateral

-   Pain may radiate down one or another leg

-   Pain is worse after periods of immobility and with particular movements (depending on where the strain is)

### Degenerative arthritis

-   Increasingly common with advancing age

-   If an osteophyte impinges a nerve root, can cause radicular symptoms in that nerve's distribution

-   Has a more insidious onset

### Spinal stenosis

-   Caused by central deformity compressing the cord, such as by central disc herniation, spondylolisthesis, osteophyte, or mass

-   Hallmark symptom is pain radiating to the legs (bilateral more common than unilateral) that is brought on by walking or standing (sometimes called pseudoclaudication)

-   Sitting relieves the symptoms

### Herniation of Intervertebral Disk

History

-   May have acute or sub-acute presentation that is precipitated by a sudden injury

-   Location of pain depends on the level of the herniation and often radiates down the leg / foot

-   Pain is often aggreviated when the hips are flexed, as in sitting, and during coughing and sneezing

-   May be associated with paresthesias and muscle weakness, such as foot drop

Physcial

-   Positive passive and crossed straight leg raise test

-   Paresthesia, and weakness on one leg

Prognosis

-   Typically is self-limited and resolves in 2 - 4 weeks

Management: NSAID + bed-rest

### Ankylosing Spondylitis

-   Chronic, painful, inflammatory arthritis primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, causing eventual fusion of the spine.

-   Often seen in patients 15-40 years old, associated with morning stiffness and achiness over the sacroiliac joint and lumbar spine.

### Spondylolisthesis

-   Anterior displacement of a vertebra or the vertebral column in relation to the vertebrae below.

-   Can occur at any age.

-   Causes aching back and posterior thigh discomfort that increases with activity or bending.

### Vertebral Fracture - Danger

Risk

-   Anyone with significant trauma, mild trauma if over 50, and no trauma if over 70

-   History of osteoporosis

-   prolonged use of corticosteroids

-   previous vertebral fracture

Physical exam

-   Bony point-tenderness in a patient with low back pain should prompt an x-ray to rule out fracture

### Cauda equina syndrome - Danger

-   Should always be considered due to the seriousness of the consequences.

-   Occurs when a large mass effect (such as an acute disc herniation or a tumor) compresses the cauda equina, causing pain radiating down the leg and can be accompanied by weakness and numbness of the leg.

-   True emergency. Decompression should be performed within 72 hours to avoid permanent neurologic deficits.

-   Low on the differential if the patient denies problem with bowel or bladder control.

### Malignancy induced bone pain - Danger

-   Important consideration. A very serious, although uncommon, cause of back pain.

-   History of cancer or unexplained weight loss (\>10 kg over 6 months)

-   Age over 50 or under 17

-   Pain is localized to the affected bones, it is a dull, throbbing pain that progresses slowly, and it increases with recumbency or cough. It does not improve with therapy, persists for more than 4 - 6 weeks, and can be present at night and at rest.

Mechanical Knee Problems
------------------------

### Knee Sprain

-   Presentation

    -   Very common condition

    -   Typically associated with trauma (which can be so minor that a person does not recall it)

    -   Can be associated with a small effusion, and with pain that worsens with weight-bearing and activity.

### Iliotibial Band Tendonitis

-   Presentation

    -   Lateral knee pain

    -   No associated trauma but there could be history of overuse (repetitive knee flexion)

    -   Pain aggravated with activity

### Tibial Apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter)

-   Presentation

    -   Most common in Children

### Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (Chrondromalacia Patellae)

-   Presentation

    -   Anterior knee Pain

    -   Without acute trauma but may have history of overuse

    -   Typically presents in women as \"theater sign\"- mild to moderate anterior knee pain, worse after prolonged sitting

### Patella Subluxation

-   Presentation

    -   Most commonly in children

### Anterior Cruciate Ligament Sprain

-   Noncontact deceleration forces resulting in general knee pain

-   Swelling within two hours of \"pop\"

### Medial Collateral Ligament Sprain

-   Presentation

    -   Immediate onset of medial joint pain/swelling after trauma such as misstep or collision

### Lateral Collateral Ligament Sprain

-   Presentation

    -   Immediate onset of lateral joint line pain

    -   Associated with varus stress

    -   Less common than medial collateral ligament sprain

-   Physical

### Meniscal Tear

-   Presentation

    -   sudden twisting injury

    -   Can occur with chronic degenerative process

-   Physical

    -   Mild effusion

    -   Possible atrophy of the vastus medialis obliquus portion of the quadriceps

    -   Catching/locking of the knee

    -   Can have positive McMurray test

### Popiteal Cyst

Most common synnovial cyst of the knee

    -   Insidious onset of mild to moderate pain in the popliteal area of the knee

Infectious Conditions of the MSK System
---------------------------------------

### Septic Arthritis

-   Presentation

    -   Abrupt onset of pain and swelling

    -   Typically only in a single joint

    -   Generalized extreme pain with any movement

    -   Risk factors include diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, prosthetic joints, recent surgery, preceding skin infection or trauma, and being over the age of 80.

-   Physical

    -   Knee exam is usually remarkable for swelling and warmth.

    -   Typically febrile, but older patients may not be febrile

-   Investigation

    -   Arthrocentesis with turbid synovial fluid and an abundance of inflammatory cells (white blood cell count 15K to \> 200K;

    -   Blood: Elevated WBC; Elevated ESR (usually \>50 mm/hr)

### Reactive Arthritis (Reiter Syndrome)

Inflammatory Conditions of the MSK System
-----------------------------------------

### Osteoarthritis

-   Presentation

    -   very common

    -   Chronic joint stiffness and pain; Usually the large joints are asymmetrically involved.

    -   Can be monoarticular in young adults if due to trauma or a congenital defect, but more commonly presents as polyarticular or generalized arthritis.

    -   No acute trauma; though past history of trauma can predispose to developing osteoarthritis

    -   Pain aggrevated by weight-bearing activities, relieved by rest

    -   Joint stiffness, if present, is typically worse after effort.

-   Physical

    -   Generalized or joint line tenderness

    -   Crepitus on exam

    -   Mild or no joint effusion

-   Investigation

-   Management

    -   Exercise

        -   Evidence for pain control and reduction of disability

        -   water- or land-based exercise, aerobic walking, quadriceps strengthening, resistance exercise, tai chi

    -   Weight loss:

    -   Acetaminophen:

        -   Not as effective as NSAIDs, but due to much better safety and side-effect profile is recommended as the first choice.

        -   Dosing is up to 4 gm per day in divided doses, though the FDA recently recommended lower doses (2-3 gm/day in divided doses) if long-term use is desired.

        -   Little risk of nephrotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity is a rare side effect if taken appropriately.

    -   NSAID

        -   Second choice to acetaminophen because of their association with gastrointestinal side-effects, acute kidney injury and hypertension.

        -   Especially true in the geriatric population because of their increased risk of acute gastrointestinal bleeding, even when used in conjunction with antacids or proton pump inhibitors.

        -   Diclofenac may be the most effective NSAID at reducing pain due to osteoarthritis.

        -   Topical diclofenac (weaker evidence) may provide benefit to some patients with knee osteoarthritis.

    -   Intra-articular corticosteroid injections

        -   Should be considered if the knee joint is inflamed, as evidenced by swelling and pain.

        -   No more than three injections per year, and no more frequent than one injection per month.

        -   Long-acting triamcinolone is typically preferred over methylprednisolone, and 1 ml of steroid should be combined with 3-4 ml local anesthetic.

        -   24 hours of immobilization following the injection helps maximize the effects, but prolonged rest should be avoided.

        -   Can reduce pain, limit the need for other medications, and improve function, but benefit is unclear from the evidence and likely of short duration.

        -   Fewer associated side effects than NSAIDs or opiates.

    -   Acupuncture: may provide some benefit

    -   Glucosamine and chondroitin: unlikely to provide benefit

    -   Other knee injections: hyaluronic acid injections, platelet rich plasma injections

    -   Tramadol (Ultram)

        -   There is good evidence that tramadol can help with pain from osteoarthritis.

        -   Tramadol is an atypical opioid and does have abuse potential, though the risk appears to be significantly lower than that of traditional opiates.

        -   Can lower seizure threshold in patients with epilepsy.

    -   To avoid

        -   Laterally directed patellar taping

        -   Knee braces

        -   Laterally wedged insoles

        -   Balance exercises

### Rheumatoid Arthritis

-   Presentation

    -   Can develop at a broad range of ages.

    -   Joint stiffness for more than thirty minutes in the morning is common.

    -   Typically bilateral joint pain, involving three or more joints (in particular the hands or feet).

-   Physical

    -   Can have associated subcutaneous nodules that are firm and nontender, and are located at pressure points.

### Psoriatic Arthritis

-   Presentation

    -   Common clinical manifestations may include peripheral arthritis, nail and skin disease, dactylitis, enthesitis and axial disease.

    -   Clinical pattern is variable, and arthritis may precede skin changes.

    -   Skin findings precede joint symptoms in up to 75% of patients.

    -   Can be difficult to distinguish from RA if skin changes not present, though less common.

### Gout

-   Presentation

    -   Acute pain and swelling without prior trauma

    -   Occurs in recurrent episodes of acute unilateral pain and swelling lasting days to weeks.

    -   Most common joint is the first metatarsophalangeal joint, though other joints such as the knees are commonly affected.

-   Physical

    -   Painful joint to touch

    -   Can be associated with tophi which are visible or palpable nodules often located on the ears or in the soft tissue. Tophi can also form in the bones, joints, and cartilage. They are typically not painful, and take years to develop.

-   Investigation

    -   Arthrocentesis with clear or slightly cloudy synovial fluid with Negatively birefringent rods

### Pseudogout

-   Presentation

    -   Acute pain and swelling without prior trauma

-   Physical

    -   Painful joint to touch

-   Investigation

    -   Arthrocentesis with clear or slightly cloudy synovial fluid with positively birefringent rhomboids
