  - Biomechanics: 
    - pupil extender - mechanical ways; shape memory; chemical dilator replacement; FEM
    - cataract surgery take out the surgery and replace with a clear lens; inject the lens require a lot of different injectors (different for each type of lens); invented disposable single handed injector that fits all lens around
    - **low-tech, high volume devices;**
    - reverse the trend of the increased healthcare cost
