Genetic Immunology and Rheumatology
================

**Struggles**

- Bedside measurement of stroke volume
- Epipen is not subsidised by the government and costs $170; so despite it being standard of care, Singaporeans do not tend to carry it unlike in the States

## Genetic Conditions and Medicine

### Pedigree

Key features for different genetic diseases

-   Autosomal dominant: equal chance man and woman

-   Autosomal recessive: skip generations, multiple affected children from unaffected parents.

-   X-link dominant: more female than male

-   X-link recessive: more male than females, skip generation inheret through maternal side

### Genetic Tests

-   Chromosome/Karyotype analysis

    -   Microscopic study of chromosomes to identify abnormalities in chromosomes number or structure

    -   Commonly ordered when

        -   patients are suspected of having a recognizable chromosomal syndrome

        -   newborns with multiple malformations of unknown etiology

        -   newborns with mbiguious genitalia

-   Direct DNA testing

    -   Indicated for patients affected or predisposed to a condition for which the gene change that causes the condition has been identified e.g. cystic fibrosis

-   Biochemical tests

    -   Identify or quantify metabolites or enzymes to measure activity

    -   Commonly used to diagnose and monitor disorders of metabolism

-   Linkage analysis

    -   Identify genetic sequences that are physically in close proximity to a disease gene of interest



### Chromosomal Abnormalities

#### Trisomy 13 / Patau Syndrome

-   Presentation

    -   Fetal U/S

        -   Holoprosencephaly
        -   Microcephaly
        -   Cleft lip / palate
        -   Omphalocele

 Infants with trisomy 13 may have many features similar to CHARGE syndrome, including heart defects, colobomas, cleft lip or palate, and cryptorchidism. However, choanal atresia is not associated with trisomy 13. In addition, trisomy 13 patients have microcephaly, which is not seen here.

Cutis aplasia (absence of epidermis over the skull) and microphthalmia are both classically seen in trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). This condition is also associated with other midline defects, including holoprosencephaly and omphalocele. Closed fists with overlapping fingers are not seen unlike in Trisomy 18.

#### Trisomy 18 / Edward Syndrome

-   Presentation

    -   fetal U/S

        -   rocker bottom feet
        -   clenched hands with overlapping fingers

This newborn's low birth weight due to **fetal growth restriction**, microcephaly, ventricular septal defect, and **closed fists with overlapping fingers** are all classic physical examination features seen in **trisomy 18** (**Edwards syndrome**). Other findings include **micrognathia, prominent occiput, rocker-bottom feet**, and severe intellectual disability.

After trisomy 21, trisomy 18 is the second most common autosomal trisomy observed in live births. The risk of trisomies increases with maternal age due to meiotic nondisjunction within maternal oocytes. Diagnosis is suspected based on prenatal ultrasonography, and karyotype (prenatal or postnatal) confirms the diagnosis. Approximately 95% of trisomy 18 patients die during their first year of life, most commonly due to cardiac failure from congenital heart disease or respiratory failure from hypoventilation or aspiration.

#### Down Syndrome

**Down syndrome** is the most common condition caused by a chromosomal abnormality. Although prevalence correlates with increasing maternal age, children of young women can also be affected. Patients who are not identified on prenatal testing are typically recognized by physical examination at birth. Neonates with Down syndrome often have **low birth weight** (eg, <2.5 kg [5.5 lbs]) and dysmorphic features, including **upslanting palpebral fissures**, epicanthic folds, and a single palmar crease.

**Hypotonia** is a prominent finding and can present with poor feeding due to a **weak suck**. On examination, an infant with weak muscle tone may have a **protruding tongue**. In contrast to infants with normal tone who have extremities flexed toward their bodies when held vertically, those with low tone may slip through the examiner's hands with arms and legs extended and floppy. Diagnosis is confirmed by an additional copy of chromosome 21 on karyotype.

-   Presentation

    -   Fetal U/S

        -   thickened nuchal fold

        -   ventricular septal defect

        -   esophageal atresia

        -   duoduenal atresia - double bubble sign

    -   Childhood

        -   Face: epicanthal folds, upslanting palpebral fissures, flat nasal bridge, protruding tongue, anomalous ears, excessive skin at nape of neck
        -   Limbs: hyperflexibility of joints, dysplasia of midphalanx of fifth finger, transverse palmar crease
        -   Neuro: Varying levels of intellectual disability, hypotonia, poor Moro reflex

    

#### Turner Syndrome

Patients with Turner syndrome (45,XO) are phenotypically female and may present with delayed puberty (eg, short stature, no breast development, amenorrhea). However, due to gonadal dysgenesis and resultant primary ovarian insufficiency, patients have **hypergonadotropic hypogonadism** (elevated FSH and LH).

clinical features (eg, **webbed neck**, carpal and pedal edema, nail dysplasia, **horseshoe kidney**) consistent with Turner syndrome (TS), a congenital disorder caused by complete or partial deletion of an X chromosome. Swelling is due to **congenital lymphedema**, which occurs in over half of patients with TS and results from **lymphatic network dysgenesis**. The dysfunctional lymphatic system causes accumulation of protein-rich interstitial fluid in the hands, feet, and neck. Severe obstruction of lymphatic vessels can result in cystic hygroma of the neck and fetal hydrops.

Congenital lymphedema typically presents at birth with **edema** that is generally **nonpitting** due to the high protein content in the interstitial fluid. In contrast, the pitting edema seen with liver failure (hypoalbuminemia), nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria), and congestive heart failure (ventricular hypocontractility) is caused by low protein concentration in the interstitial fluid

Patients with TS typically have **ovarian dysgenesis**, leading to "streak ovaries" (small ovaries with little to no follicles) and primary ovarian insufficiency. Because ovaries normally produce estrogen, patients with TS are **estrogen deficient**, which leads to **amenorrhea** and minimal or no breast development (thelarche). Estrogen also inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; therefore, patients with TS have increased bone resorption, decreased bone mineral density, and increased risk of **osteoporotic fracture**. Estrogen replacement therapy is given to girls with TS to promote normal sexual maturation and reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures.

Horseshoe kidney may increase the risk of urinary infections, but renal function is typically normal. Aortic coarctation is also associated with TS and, if severe, can decrease renal perfusion and lead to kidney failure over time. However, an open ductus arteriosus during the first few days of life is protective against renal damage.

Most patients with TS have normal cognitive abilities. However, there is an increased risk of impaired nonverbal skills (eg, mathematics), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and problems with executive functioning.

#### Klinefelter Syndrome

Patients with Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) are phenotypically male and present with **hypergonadotropic hypogonadism** (elevated FSH and LH) due to testicular damage during development. Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) is the most common sex chromosome abnormality causing primary hypogonadism.  Newborns typically have normal male external genitalia and no apparent dysmorphic features. After puberty, small testes and tall stature become apparent.

A tall and slender stature, but not connective tissue problems, is seen in Klinefelter syndrome.



#### Fragile X syndrome

Most common form of inherited intellectual disability. It is associated with unstable CGG (cytosine-guanine-guanine) trinucleotide repeats on the X chromosome.

-   Clinical features

    -   Intellectual disability
    -   Macrocephaly
    -   Face: long narrow face, protruding ears
    -   Macroorchidism
    -   A/W ADHD, autism

Fragile X syndrome is the most common X-linked inherited cause of intellectual disability.  Affected boys have a prominent forehead and macroorchidism in contrast to PWS.

Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked disorder that may present with hypotonia in infancy but does not typically cause low birth weight like Down Syndrome



#### Super Female

Patients with a 47,XXX genotype typically have normal secondary sexual characteristic development and tall stature. FSH and LH levels are normal.

### Autosomal Recessive Disease

#### **Wilson disease**

Rare, autosomal recessive disease of younger individuals that is characterized by abnormal **copper deposition** in tissues such as the liver, basal ganglia, and cornea. The **liver** is typically the initial site of copper accumulation. All forms of hepatic involvement (eg, elevated aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, or bilirubin) may be seen. Steatosis and fibrosis can progress to inflammation and necrosis, with hepatocyte ballooning and formation of Mallory bodies (damaged intermediate filaments). However, these histopathologic findings are not specific for Wilson disease. The neurologic symptoms of Wilson disease are due to copper deposition in the basal ganglia. 

**Presentation**

- Children and adolescents tend to present with **liver disease** (ranging from asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations to fulminant hepatic failure), 
- whereas young adults tend to demonstrate **neuropsychiatric disease** (ranging widely from tremor and rigidity to depression, paranoia, and catatonia).

**Diagnosis**

- Classically, the diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of **low serum ceruloplasmin** (particularly <20 mg/dL) in conjunction with increased urinary copper excretion 
-  slit lamp examination of the eyes: **Kayser–Fleischer rings** (due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane).

### Single Gene Conditions

#### Alpha-1 trysin deficiency

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is typically associated with emphysema and liver involvement at a young age. Liver biopsy will show hepatocytes containing granules that are PAS positive and diastase-resistant.



#### Hemochromatosis

Serum iron and ferritin levels are of benefit in evaluating a patient for hemochromatosis. Although hemochromatosis typically involves the liver, symptoms tend to develop after age 40 and the liver biopsy shows marked iron deposition. Moreover, the presence of such distinctive neuropsychiatric symptoms supports a diagnosis of Wilson disease.



#### cri-du-chat (5p deletion) syndrome

Infants with this syndrome have cat-like cry,  may also have microcephaly; however, a characteristic protruding metopic suture is present. Other manifestations are hypotonia, short stature, hypertelorism, wide and flat nasal bridge, and intellectual disability.



#### Hereditary Angioedema

This autosomal dominant disorder is typically caused by a **deficiency** in or dysfunction of **C1 inhibitor** (previously referred to as C1 esterase inhibitor). A C1 inhibitor defect leads to **elevated bradykinin**, which causes edema.

**Clinical Features**

- Hereditary angioedema typically presents in late childhood or adolescence with an acute onset of swelling after a dental procedure, **stress**, or trauma. 
- The **face**, limbs, and genitalia are most commonly affected. 
- **Bowel wall** edema presents as colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, the most life-threatening risk is laryngeal edema, which can cause **laryngospasm** and airway obstruction.

**Diagnosis**

- Confirmed by complement testing: 
  - Exaggerated cleavage of C4 by C1 complex causes **depressed C4 levels**, 
  - and low levels of C1 inhibitor protein or C1 inhibitor function
- Differentials
  - ACEi-induced angioedema: also secondary to bradykinin elevation; not triggered by stress

**Treatment**

- acute swelling typically involves C1 inhibitor concentrate;
- a bradykinin antagonist (eg, **icatibant**) or kallikrein inhibitor (eg, **ecallantide**) may be effective in resistant cases.

#### Friedreich ataxia**

Friedreich ataxia (FA) classically presents as **progressive gait ataxia** and dysarthria in **adolescents** or young adults. FA is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat (GAA) expansion that results in a loss-of-function mutation in the *frataxin* gene. Neurologic manifestations (eg, ataxia, **dysarthria**, loss of vibration/position sense) result from degeneration of the spinal tracts (ie, spinocerebellar tracts, posterior columns). Other clinical features include **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**, diabetes mellitus, and skeletal deformities (eg, scoliosis).

**Genetics**

- Autosomal recessive
- Loss-of-function, trinucleotide repeat (GAA) in *frataxin* gene

**Clinical features**

- Neurologic deficits
  - Cerebellar ataxia
  - Dysarthria
  - Loss of vibration and/or position sense
  - Absent deep tendon reflexes
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Skeletal deformities (eg, scoliosis)
- Diabetes mellitus
- MRI of the brain and spinal cord shows marked atrophy of the medulla and dorsal columns of the spinal cord. 

**Prognosis**

- Mean survival age 30-40
- Mortality due to cardiac dysfunction (eg, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure)

Treatment typically involves multidisciplinary supportive care and monitoring for complications; there is no specific disease-modifying therapy. After disease onset, survival rarely exceeds 20 years. The most common **cause of death** is **cardiac dysfunction** related to cardiomyopathy, typically a fatal arrhythmia or congestive heart failure.

#### Ataxia-telangiectasia 

An autosomal recessive disorder that presents with immunodeficiency, progressive cerebellar ataxia, and ocular and cutaneous telangiectasias. Patients with ataxia-telangiectasia have deficits in DNA repair that increase the risk of malignancy. 

#### Prader-Willis Syndrome

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a sporadic disorder due to **maternal uniparental disomy**. Normally, people inherit 2 active copies of each gene - 1 from the mother and 1 from the father. Patients with PWS inherit both copies of a section of chromosome 15 from their mother.  The **deletion of the paternal copy of chromosome 15q11-q13** results in **poor suck and feeding problems in infancy** followed by a life of compulsive **binge-eating** and obesity-related problems. Other common manifestations are shown in the table.

- Hypotnonia
- Weak suck / feeding problems in infancy
- Hyperphagia / obesity
- Short stature
- Hypogonadism
- Intellectual disability
- Dysmorphic facies
  - Narrow forehead
  - Almond-shaped eyes
  - Downturned mouth

Genetic testing is required to confirm diagnosis and begins with karyotype and methylation studies, followed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization, and then microsatellite probes. 

Management revolves around **obesity** and its complications. Patients benefit from a structured eating environment and strict limitation of food intake (eg, locks on refrigerator, close supervision).  They should be screened for **sleep apnea** (central and obstructive) as well as **type 2 diabetes mellitus**. Some patients undergo growth hormone therapy to improve linear growth and body composition, including fat-free mass and bone density. Other complications include **gastric distension / rupture**, as well as **death by choking.**

patients with PWS have hypogonadism and almond-shaped eyes rather than upslanting palpebral fissures.

#### Angelman Syndrome

Patients with **Angelman syndrome** suffer from paternal uniparental disomy (eg, deletion of the maternal copy of chromosome 15q11-q13). As in PWS, these patients may have short stature and intellectual disability. However, other unique features include frequent **smiling/laughter**, hand-flapping, ataxia, and seizures.



#### Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome 

A congenital disorder due to disregulation of imprinted gene expression in chromosome 11p15. Characteristic physical findings include macroglossia, rapid growth, hemihyperplasia, and umbilical hernia or omphalocele.

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by macrosomia, hemihyperplasia (asymmetric overgrowth of one side of the body), omphalocele, and macroglossia.

#### Marfan Syndrome

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder of the *fibrillin-1 gene* that results in systemic weakening of connective tissue. Classic skeletal manifestations include **joint hypermobility**, skin hyperelasticity, long fingers (**arachnodactyly** ["thumb sign"]), **pectus excavatum**, and **scoliosis/kyphosis**. The face is long, the palate has a high arch, and the teeth are crowded. **Lens dislocation** (ectopia lentis), iridodonesis (a rapid contraction and dilation of the iris), and myopia (from elongation of the globe) are also typical.

The most life-threatening finding in Marfan syndrome is **aortic root dilation**. The diastolic murmur in this patient reflects **aortic regurgitation**. The syndrome requires close monitoring with echocardiography for the development of **aneurysms** and **aortic arch dissection**. Mitral valve prolapse is also common and manifests as a mid-systolic click and late systolic murmur. First-degree relatives should undergo genetic testing.

#### Congenital contractural arachnodactyly

 is an autosomal dominant condition resulting from mutations of the *fibrillin-2 gene*. These patients have tall stature, arachnodactyly, and multiple contractures involving large joints. Ocular and cardiovascular symptoms are not present in congenital contractural arachnodactyly. In addition, patients with Marfan syndrome do not have joint contractures.

#### Homocystinuria 

is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from deficiency of **cystathionine synthase,** an enzyme involved in the metabolism of methionine. These patients share many features of Marfan syndrome (eg, pectus deformity, tall stature, arachnodactyly). However, they usually have a fair complexion, thromboembolic events, and intellectual disability. The other main differentiating feature is lens dislocation in homocystinuria that is downward rather than upward.

#### McCune-Albright Sydrome

In addition to precocious puberty, this patient has **irregular café-au-lait macules** confined to one side of the body and recurrent fractures due to **polyostotic fibrous dysplasia**, characteristic of **McCune-Albright syndrome** (MAS). MAS is a rare cause of precocious puberty due to a mutation in the *GNAS* gene, which results in constant G protein activation and overproduction of pituitary hormones. Therefore, in addition to **GnRH-independent (ie, peripheral)** precocious puberty (FSH, LH), MAS can also lead to thyrotoxicosis (TSH), acromegaly (GH), and Cushing syndrome (ACTH).

*A 6-year-old girl is brought to the office for evaluation of pubic hair development. The girl's mother reports first noticing axillary hair a few weeks ago while dressing her for school. The patient has also had breast and pubic hair development but no vaginal bleeding, headaches, emesis, or visual disturbances. She has no medical conditions and takes no daily medications. The patient had 2 long bone fractures at ages 4 and 5. Family history is unremarkable. Physical examination reveals 2 large hyperpigmented macules with irregular contours on the left side of her back and chest. Axillae have secondary hair; there is no freckling. Bilateral breasts have budding and enlargement of the areola. There is coarse, dark pubic hair along the labia and the pubic junction.*

#### Neurofibromatosis

##### Type I - von Recklinghausen Disease

NF1 is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation to the *NF1* gene on chromosome 17, which codes for neurofibromin.

**Clinical Features**

- Starting in childhood, patients usually develop characteristic skin and soft tissue findings, including café-au-lait macules (numerous ≥6 with regular borders), **freckling** in skinfolds, and Lisch nodules.
- Approximately 15% of patients with NF1 who are age <6 also develop low-grade optic pathway glioma. These tumors are often asymptomatic but can grow large enough to compress the optic nerve and cause **decreased visual acuity**, alterations in color vision, optic nerve atrophy, and **proptosis**.
  - can cause precocious puberty (due to optic glioma affecting the hypothalamus) 
- Multiple neurofibromas

##### Type II - Central Neurofibromastosis

Condition due to mutation in *NF2* tumor suppressor gene; codes the protein **merlin** on chromosome 22. 

**Clinical Features**

- present with hearing loss and difficulty with balance: Bilateral acoustic neuromas, or vestibular schwannomas, are benign tumors that arise from the eighth cranial nerve (CN VIII). 



#### Tuberous sclerosis

A neurocutaneous disorder that can cause central precocious puberty due to brain hamartomas. However, associated skin lesions include hypopigmented ash-leaf spots and shagreen patches.

#### Chediak-Higashi Syndrome

Chediak-Higashi syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by partial oculocutaneous albinism and recurrent cutaneous infections. *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus pyogenes* are common. 

## Immune Conditions

- CD19+ = B-cells
- CD3+  = T-cells

Immunoglobulin 免疫球蛋白

### Combined Immune Deficiency

#### Severe Combined Immune Deficiency

Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a life-threatening condition caused by **impaired T cell development** and subsequent **B cell dysfunction** due to absent T cells.  Its inheritance can be x-linked recessive or autosomal recessive.

**Clinical Features**

- Recurrent, severe viral, fungal, or opportunistic (i.e. Pneumocystis) infection in infancy due to defects in cellular immunity
-  The loss of CD4+ T cells also leads to B cell (humoral immunity) dysfunction, increasing the risk for sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal bacterial infections. 
- Chronic diarrhoea, failure to thrive, absence of lymphoid tissue on examination
-  Hypogammaglobulinemia, and markedly low T cell counts

**Diagnosis**

- SCID is included in routine newborn screening in the United States and is detected by the absence of T cell receptor excision circles (circular DNA excreted by developing T cells in the thymus) in dried blood.
- Differential
  - Perinatal HIV: similar presentation but HIV test will be positive

**Management**

-  Avoid live attenuated vaccinations (eg, measles-mumps-rubella, varicella): develop rash, leukopenia, and infection.  Inactivated vaccines are not contraindicated but will not result in protective immunity due to poor humoral response.
- Intravenous immunoglobulin and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy are short-term management options for SCID while awaiting transplantation. 
- **Stem cell transplantation** is the only definitive therapy and should be performed as early as possible. Replacement of defective immature T cells with normal hematopoietic cells allows the development of a functional immune system. SCID is usually fatal in early childhood unless transplantation is performed.

#### Adenosine deaminase deficiency 

An autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency, which is characterized by deficient formation of mature B and T lymphocytes. Severe combined immunodeficiency presents with severe infections and failure to thrive. Laboratory studies show marked lymphopenia.

#### Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome

An X-linked recessive disease characterised by impaired cytoskeleton changes.

**Clinical Features**

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome classically presents in infancy with 

- recurrent sinopulmonary infections
- atopic eczema
- lymphopenia
- thrombocytopenia: microthrombocytopenia with bleeding (eg, post circumcision, bleeding from umbilical stump) 
- T cell dysfunction and hypogammaglobulinemia worsen with age and present as bacterial, viral, and opportunistic infections.

**Management**

- Hematopoietic stem cell transplant

#### DiGeorge Syndrome

Associated with a deletion of chromosome 22q11 affecting pharyngeal pouch development. DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome) can present with the classic triad of congenital heart disease, T cell deficiency, and hypocalcemia. **Impaired T cell production** leads to deficient cellular immunity (eg, recurrent viral and fungal infections). However, B cell concentrations are not affected.

-   Presentation

    -   dysmorphic facies
    -   Abnormal conotruncal cardiac development
    -   Hypoplastic thymus - deficient T cell function
    -   Hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism
    -   A/W developmental delay, social and emotional skill deficits

DiGeorge syndrome results from a chromosome 22q11.2 microdeletion and presents with heart defects, hypocalcemia, and thymic hypoplasia. Coloboma and choanal atresia are not features of DiGeorge syndrome.

Diagnosis

- definitively diagnosed by fluorescence in situ hybridization

In DiGeorge syndrome, lack of thymic tissue prevents maturation of hematopoietic precursors, so cultured thymic transplant can be curative. 

### Humoral Immunodeficiency Syndromes

- All presents with recurrent and or severe sinopulmonary infections with viruses and encapsulated bacterial

- Complete blood count with differential, lymphocyte T and B cell subsets, and serum IgG, IgA, and IgM are important screening tests. 
- HIV infection should also be excluded.
- Intravenous immunoglobulin can be used for long-term therapy in certain humoral immunodeficiency syndromes (eg, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency).

| Condition                                                    | B-cell Count | IgG    | IgA    | Ig M     | IgE    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------ | ------ | -------- | ------ |

| Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of Infancy / Ig G subclass deficiency | Normal       | &darr; | Normal | Variable | Normal |



#### Bruton Agammaglobulinemia

A recessive disorder characterised by a **defect in tyrosine kinase in B cells**. This defect results in **failed development of bone marrow pre-B cells into mature circulating B cells**, which also leads to low immunoglobulin production.

**Clinical Feature**

- When protection from maternally-derived transplacental IgG antibodies wanes at **age 3-6 months**, patients with XLA develop recurrent **sinopulmonary** (eg, acute otitis media, pneumonia) and **gastrointestinal** (eg, *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*) infections that can be severe or chronic. 
- Physical examination in older children with XLA shows underdeveloped lymphoid tissue (eg, tonsils, lymph nodes). However, these tissues are not prominent even in healthy children until after age 2 years. 
- markedly **low serum immunoglobulins**
- **few B lymphocytes** (given by: Total lymphocytes – T cell lymphocytes = B cell lymphocytes; 2000-1960 = 40)

**Management**

- Monthly intravenous immunoglobulin administration: restoring serum immunoglobulin concentrations
- Antibiotics are given for infections and may be given prophylactically if intravenous immunoglobulin alone is unsuccessful.
- Live vaccines are contraindicated in XLA; other vaccines are not contraindicated but are incapable of generating a meaningful antibody response in patients with XLA.

#### Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)

CVID is a collective diagnosis that includes a number of genetic defects resulting in **impaired B cell differentiation** and **hypogammaglobulinemia**. Most cases of CVID are due to sporadic mutation, and family history of the disease is typically absent (as in this patient). CVID is one of the most common primary immunodeficiencies in adults.

**Clinical Features**

- Can present in childhood (around puberty) or, more commonly, in adulthood (age 20-40).
- Characterized mainly by increased **susceptibility to bacterial infection**. 
  - Recurrent **respiratory infections** (eg, pneumonia, sinusitis, otitis) , frequently from encapsulated organisms such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae* and Chronic lung disease (eg, bronchiectasis, asthma)
  - Recurrent **gastrointestinal infections** (eg, *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*) are common, and the latter may lead to episodes of bloody diarrhea. 
  - Chronic giardiasis may occur
  - Note that opportunistic infections (eg, *Candida*, *Pneumocystis jirovecii*) are rare unlike in SCID
  - In cases in which T-cell immunity is also affected, patients are also at increased risk for enteroviral encephalitis. 
- Additional conditions
  - Concomitant **autoimmune disease** (eg, hemolytic anemia, RA, thyroid disease, pernicious anemia), 
  - Inflammatory bowel-like disease
  - Granuloma development
  - Increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
  - Enteropathy (eg, sprue-like illness) is common, and affected patients may present with malabsorption and weight loss.

**Diagnosis**

- Diagnosis is made by **quantitative measurement of immunoglobulin levels**: ↓↓ IgG, ↓ IgA/IgM
- Markedly reduced or absent immune response to vaccination.

**Differential**

- In comparison to Bruton agammaglobulinemia, CVID is 
  - less severe 
  - presents at a later age 
  - with normal T cell and B cell counts.

**Management**

- Management of CVID is focused on avoiding infection, so the mainstay of treatment is i**ntravenous immunoglobulin infusion**.
- Early initiation of therapy may prevent some complications of chronic infection. 
- Patients with CVID have increased risk of autoimmune disease and certain malignancies regardless of treatment.
- Because cellular immunity is usually adequate in CVID, patients do not routinely require antiviral or antifungal prophylaxis.

#### Hyper **IgM** Syndrome

In this patient, the **low serum IgA and IgG** in combination with the **markedly elevated IgM** is concerning for hyper-IgM syndrome, which is due to an **X-linked** genetic defect in the **CD40 ligand**. The CD40 ligand is present on T cells and binds to CD40 expressed on B cells, which induces a change in B cell production of IgM to other immunoglobulins (class switching). The absence of the CD40 ligand prevents class switching, leading to elevated IgM levels and a deficiency of all other immunoglobulin types. CD40 ligand deficiency also inhibits plasma cell formation, which contributes to poor response to infection and immunization.

Patients with hyper-IgM syndrome have recurrent sinopulmonary infections (eg, acute otitis media, pneumonia, sinusitis) with encapsulated bacteria. They also tend to have more frequent viral infections and increased risk of opportunistic infections, such as *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia. Growth impairment can result from high energy expenditure and poor intake during illness. Treatment includes antibiotic prophylaxis and interval administration of intravenous immunoglobulin.

#### Selective IgA deficiency

Most common primary immune deficiency. Serum IgA levels are low or undetectable due to failure of B cells to differentiate into IgA-secreting plasma cells; serum IgG and IgM levels are normal. 

**Clinical Features**

- Usually asymptomatic
- Recurrent sinopulmonary (eg, sinusitis, pneumonia)  and gastrointestinal infections (eg, *Giardia*) due to absence of secretory IgA as a mucosal barrier.
- Associated with autoimmune disease (eg. systemic lupus erythematosus, celiac disease) and atopy (e.g. asthma, eczema)
- Patients with severe IgA deficiency can form IgE antibodies directed against IgA (anti-IgA antibodies). When transfused with **blood products** (eg, red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma) containing small amounts of IgA, these patients can develop potentially fatal **anaphylaxis**. 

**Diagnosis**

- Low or absent IgA
- Normal IgG, IgM levels, B cells

Management

- Supportive care
- Medical alert bracelet for anaphylactic transfusion reactions (for severe deficiency)
- 


#### Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy

 The normal physiologic nadir of maternally derived antibody is age 3-6 months in term infants. Low serum IgG levels after age 6 months is termed transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy, and it usually resolves by age 12 months. B and T lymphocyte counts and IgA and IgM levels are normal.

Characterized by decreased IgG, variable IgM, and normal IgA and B cell concentrations. Affected patients present with increased sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections that are usually mild rather than life-threatening. Immunoglobulin levels generally normalize by age 9-15 months.

### Innate Immunity Conditions

#### Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency

LAD is caused by defective integrins on the leukocyte surface, which normally allow neutrophils to adhere to vascular endothelium, exit the vasculature, and migrate to areas of infection or inflammation.

Lack of neutrophil migration in LAD results in recurrent **skin** (eg, cellulitis, abscess, omphalitis) and **mucosal** (eg, periodontal) **infections** as well as poor wound healing. Examination shows inflammation with a notable **lack of purulence**. Biopsy of infected tissue is devoid of neutrophils and culture often grows *Staphylococcus aureus* or Gram-negative bacilli. Peripheral serum studies show marked leukocytosis and **neutrophilia**, particularly during episodes of infection. Classically, the first presenting sign of LAD is delayed umbilical cord separation (age >3 weeks).

#### Chronic Granulomatous Disease

Chronic granulomatous disease is a **defect of the NADPH oxidase in phagocytic cells**, which leads to respiratory burst from activated phagocytes and hence impaired intracellular killing of catalase-positive organisms (eg, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Serratia marcescens*). Majority of cases **X-linked recessive**.

**Clinical Features**

- Recurrent skin infections, skin abscesses, lung abscesses, and fungal infections.
- Patients with CGD present with infections from **catalase-positive organisms** (eg, *Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Burkholderia cepacia*). The **lungs** (eg, pneumonia, empyema) and **skin/soft tissue** (eg, abscesses, lymphadenitis) are the most common sites of infection. 
- Other common infections include suppurative adenitis and osteomyelitis.
- Leukocyte, platelet, and B and T cell concentrations are normal in CGD.
- Phagocytic cells filled with bacteria are a frequent finding on Gram stain.

**Diagnosis**

- Neutrophil function testing
  - Dihydrorhodamine 123 test
  - Nitroblue tetrazolium test
- Differential
  - **Cyclic bone marrow suppression** results in cyclic neutropenia. Unlike in this patient, fever and illness typically occur in predictable patterns every 2-5 weeks and are usually associated with oral lesions (eg, aphthous ulcers). Although bacterial infections may occur, *Serratia* is not typical. Failure to thrive is not characteristic.
  - Failure of membrane attack complex formation is the hallmark of **terminal complement deficiency** (C5-C9). However, patients with this condition are susceptible to *Neisseria* (rather than *S aureus* or *Serratia*) infections, and failure to thrive and recurrent abscesses are not typical features.
  - **Hypersecretion of IgE** (Hyper-IgE syndrome, Job syndrome) presents with recurrent skin abscesses, pulmonary infections, and *S aureus* infections. However, characteristic facial features (eg, broad nose) and bony abnormalities (eg, scoliosis) are typical, and inheritance is often autosomal dominant (so parental history would be expected).
  - **Hypogammaglobulinemia** in 2 male siblings could be seen in X-linked agammaglobulinemia. However, typical infections include sinopulmonary infections and bacteremia. Recurrent abscess formation and *Serratia* infections are less typical.
  - Impaired neutrophil chemotaxis is seen in leukocyte adhesion deficiency. Patients are susceptible to recurrent infections, including *S aureus*; however, pus formation is unusual, and inheritance is usually autosomal recessive, so presentation is not gender-specific.

**Differential**

- Unlike those with leukocyte adhesion deficiency, patients with CGD do not have neutrophilia 

**Management**

- Lifelong antimicrobial prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and itraconazole
- Patients with severe phenotypes benefit from immunomodulators such as interferon-gamma injections

#### Complement deficiencies

Patients with complement deficiencies are at increased risk for disseminated bacterial infections, particularly with **encapsulated bacteria** (eg, *Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis)*. Cutaneous infections and neutrophilia are not seen as in leukocyte adhesion deficiency.

CH50 assays are used to determine total complement concentration. Complement deficiencies present with recurrent infections from encapsulated bacteria, particularly *Neisseria*. 

### Type I Hypersensitivity

Allergic Reactions include

- **Urticaria:** Oedematous and pruritic plaques with a pale centre and raised borders. Caused by blood vessel dilatation and oedema developing at the dermis
- **Angiooedema:** Well-defined, non-pitting, non-pruritic swelling caused by oedema of the deeper layers of the skin (deeper layers have fewer mast cells and sensory nerve endings) but may cause burning, numbness, or pain.
  - Worry oedematous tongue resulting in airway obstruction; also makes intubation very very difficult. This is often how angioedema kills.
- **Anaphylaxis:** A severe, potentially fatal, systemic allergic reaction to an antigen that is precipitated by the abrupt release of chemical mediators in a previously sensitised patient. 

#### Urticaria

**Management**

- Antihistamine
- Oral prednisolone for 3 - 5 day duration

#### Angioedema



#### Anaphylaxis

Anaphylaxis is a **life-threatening** syndrome caused by the sudden, massive degranulation of mast cells and basophils; it is a multisystem disease that usually affects **≥2 organ systems**. Most (>90%) cases are associated with **skin or mucosal manifestations**, including swelling of the lips or tongue, urticaria, pruritus, or flushing. Most cases of anaphylaxis occur due to type I hypersensitivity to an allergen, including foods, insect stings, and **medications** (amoxicillin). New allergies and anaphylaxis may **develop at any age**.

**Triggers**

- Food
- Medications (e.g. beta-lactam antibiotics)
- Insect stings

**Diagnosis**

- Use one of three criteria
  - 2 or more systems involved 
  - Skin and something else (respiratory or HoTN)
  - HoTN minutes to hours after exposure to allergen - often forgotten, remember
- The symptoms for various systems are
  - Cutaneous: urticarial rash, pruritus, flushing, facial and periorbital swelling
  - Ocular: **conjunctival erythema**, periorbital edema
  - Neurologic: confusion, seizure
  - Cardiovascular: vasodilator leads to hypotension and tissue edema, tachycardia
  - Respiratory: upper airway edema leads to stridor and hoarseness, bronchospasm leads to wheezing
  - Gastrointestinal: N/V abdominal pain
- Common triggers: stings, peanuts, seafoods antibiotics (penicillins), contrast media, NSAIDs, even hydrocortisone

**Management**

- Key Points

  - **Early IM adrenaline** at the **correct dose** is the single most important treatment
    - Fat less vascularised so the absorption is less predictable; do not give SC.
  - Be aware of **biphasic reactions**: Recurrence of symptoms WITHOUT 2nd exposure to allergen
    - 1-20% of pts with anaphylaxis experience biphasic reactions
    - Usually 4-8 hours after initial reaction but may occur >24 hours after
    - Possible risk factors include:
      - delayed administration of adrenaline 
      - slow response to adrenaline

      - need for repeated doses of adrenaline 
      - need for IV fluids
    - Biphasic reaction is also more refractory to adrenaline... so even more important to avoid it, give Adrenaline early!
  - Remember to update allergen in **clinical notes / HIDS**, provide a **medik awas card**, and be give **appropriate advice** on discharge

- History and Physical

  - Symptoms and time on onset is key
  - New medication / food take / stings and time of exposure
  - Previous known allergies (both food and drug)
  - Use of auto injector? (overseas)
  - Other past medical conditions include asthma etc.

- Investigations

  - Bedside vitals monitoring
  - No other investigations because they do not change management
    - Serum Tryptase may be used to diagnose anaphylaxis but is not used
      - released from secretory vesicles of mast cells
      - take blood at 1, 6 and 24 hours; serum separated and stored at 20 C
      - normal: <1ng/mL
      - non-specific and anaphylactoid reactions: 1-15ng/mL 
      - true anaphylaxis levels: >15ng/mL

- Treatment Algorithm

  1. Remove allergen if possible, call for help

  2. Resuscitate Patient

     - Airway
       - assess for airway obstruction: globus sensation, change in voice (vocal cord swelling), stridor, swollen tongue and uvula
       - SGH: routinely scope everyone with anaphylaxis to look for vocal cord edema
       - secure airway / intubate if necessary (note that this is a **difficult airway**)
     - Breathing
       - supplemental O2 if necessary
     - Circulation
       - 2 large bore IV cannulas in antecubital, supine position
       - **IV crystalloid bolus** if hypotensive

  3. Symptomatic Treatment

     - **IM adrenaline 1:1000 0.3-0.5mg STAT**, repeat **every 5 -10mins** if no improvement

       - Agonist effects on the &alpha;1 and &beta;2 receptors, resulting in vasoconstriction (which increases blood pressure and reduces edema) and bronchodilation (which relieves bronchospasm), respectively.
       - Use anterolateral thigh (not deltoid) for faster absorption - because it is a bigger muscle
       - **NO absolute contraindication** to adrenaline in severe anaphylaxis (even in pts with heart disease); This is the ONLY treatment that is PROVEN to improve outcome.
       - Consider **IV in refractory hypotension/peri-collapse**
         - IV infusion 1:100,000 (ICU dose) 0.02-0.2 mcg/kg/min (via deep IM injection if IV access is unavailable) - start low and readjust
         - Noradrenaline may also be used, IV infusion given at same rate as adrenaline

     - Antihistamines

       - **IV diphenhydramine 25-50mg** (H1 blocker)
       - **IV ranitidine 50mg** (H2 blocker - low evidence, just give since low side effect)

       Antihistamines help relieve hives and pruritus; however, they do not prevent the life-threatening manifestations of anaphylaxis (eg, respiratory obstruction, hypotension). No evidence to suggest mortality benefit.

     - Steroids: 

       - **IV hydrocortisone 100-200mg** 
         - or PO Prednisone 0.5-1mg/kg max 50mg but not preferred
       - In SGH: **IV hydrocortisone 200 mg stat** + discharge with **PO prednisolone 30 mg x 5 days**

       Glucocorticoids have a slow onset of action (4 - 6 hours); although they were thought to prevent **recurrent anaphylaxis**, this has largely been unsupported in studies (Cochrane Review 2012 indicates poor evidence).

     - +/- Neb **Salbutamol** for bronchospasm

  4. Team Formation and Patient Disposition

     | Condition             | Disposition  | Remark                                                       |
     | --------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
     | Severe                | HD/ICU       | Intubated, still on IV adrenaline / noradrenaline            |
     | Severe but stabilised | General ward | Repeated doses of IM adrenaline, initial hypotension requiring fluid bolus, slow response to adrenaline |
     | Observation in ED     | ED           | Observation period ranges from 4-8hrs, some recommend a 24-hour waiting period |

  5. Discharge advice

     - Provide **prescriptions** – antihistamines and PO prednisolone 30-50mg x5 days
     - Discharge with **advice** to return / call ambulance if symptoms recur, explain possibility of biphasic reactions up to >24 hours
     - **Prevention**: advice on allergen avoidance (if trigger known), update allergy in clinical notes / NEHR, provide medik awas card
     - Arrange **follow up** with an allergist / immunologist
     - Prescribe and teach use of adrenaline **auto-injector** if possible
       - What: Epipen – **0.3mg epinephrine** / Epipen Jr – 0.15mg epinephrine (15-30kg)
       - Storage: Should not be refrigerated
       - How to use: remove safety cap, push on outer mid-thigh, hold for 3 seconds
       - After use: Will STILL need to follow up and call ambulance even after administration of Epipen

**Questions:**

- How to give deep IM?

- Concentration for IV adrenaline

- If patient has used epipen, and symptoms resolved? do we just observe patient when they arrive by ambulance? And if the symptoms does not resolve does it change the management? Would we consider IM or treat as refractory and do IV?

  - Overseas people have autoinjector - in Singapore it a matter of cost

  - What's the definition of refractory?

### Type II Hypersensitivity

- Immune hemolytic anemia and Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn
- IgG or IgM antibodies react with cell-bound antigens, leading to complement activation and cell destruction. 

### Type III Hypersensitivity

Aka  Immune complex–mediated hypersensitivity

#### Serum Sickness

Antibody complexes activate the complement cascade wherever the immune complexes deposit. Joint swelling, fever, and rash are typical findings.

### Type IV Hypersensitivity

Direct contact of the allergen with the skin causes dermal inflammation and a localized rash after a latent period of 1-2 days.

#### Allergic Contact Dermatitis

#### Tuberculin skin test
