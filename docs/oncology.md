Oncology
========

- Palliative chemotherapy: patient is not 
- Curative chemotherapy: Adjuvant chemotherapy vs Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
  - **Neoadjuvant** therapy encompasses all treatments that are administered before the primary cancer treatment, whereas **adjuvant** therapy describes regimens administered after the primary treatment.

## Paraneoplastic Syndromes

Divide into general conditions that applies for most cancers and some cancer specific problems

### General Conditions

#### Non-specific symptoms: 

-   GI disturbances, 
-   renal failure, 
-   neuropsychiatric conditions, 
-   coma and death

#### Cachexia

This is itself a syndrome, characterized by loss of body weight of 10%, reduced food intake and systemic inflammation

-   Adipose tissue loss due to Zinc-&alpha;2-glycoprotein, inhibition of lipoprotein lipase by cytokines (TNF-&alpha;, IL-1, IFN-&alpha;), Cori cycle is the main metablism pathway of tumor and is only performing glycolysis, Uncoupling proteins UCP1-UCP5 in mitochondrial inner mmb results in a lack of ATP production
-   Decreased protein synthesis not corrected by dietary supplementation plus increased protein catabolism; Proteolysis-inducing factor by tumor, cytokines (TNF-&alpha;, IFN-&alpha;); Activate NF-&kappa;&beta; and proteosome degradation ubiquitination of myofibrillar proteins

#### Anemia

Chronic production of acute phase markers, IL-6 decreases iron circulation and TNF etc decreases body response to EPO

#### Hypercoagulability

Increased risk of DVT and PE due to

-   Extrinsic vascular compression / invasion

-   Tissue factor production by tumor and endothelial cells

-   Accentuated platelet activation and accumulation

-   Expression of posyphatidyl serine that supports prothrombinase and tenase activity, inflammation-mediated increase in factor VIII, fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor

-   Impaired endogenous fibrinolysis due to excess level of plasminogen activator-inhibitor 1

#### Hypercalcemia due to Malignancy

Most common metabolic abnormality -- 10% of cancers

-   Osteoclast resorption of bone due to endocrine (PTH) and paracine (local factors from bone mets inc RANKL, IL-1, TNF-&alpha;, TGF-&alpha;) effects

### Specific Conditions

#### Endocrine Abnormalities

Occurs in endocrine tumors

-   Carcinoid Sydnromes for Carcinoid Tumor
    -   Amyloidosis for Multiple Myeloma / Plasmacytoma

        -   Generally there is deposition of protin in &beta; pleated sheets from the tumor

        -   Or if plasma cells then there is deposition of immunoglobulin
-   Hypertensive Crisis for Pheochromocytoma

#### Neutropenic Sepsis

#### Malignant Pleural Effusion

#### Malignant Ascites

#### Spinal Cord Compression

#### Superior Vena Cava Obstruction

#### Tumor Lysis Syndrome

Which of the following is a possible cause of his thyroid function

- Wholebrain RT - induced thyroiditis
- Cancer immunotherapy
- Metastatic disease involving thyroid gland
- Metastatic disease involving pituitary gland

See primary hyperthyroidism, as evident by a low T4 and high TSH. Most likely cause is cancer immunotherapy (or BAT)

Central Nervous System Tumors
-----------------------------

### Schwannoma

-   Diagnosis: S100 stain

Cardiac Tumors
--------------

### Cardiac fibroma

-   Compromise cardiac function, lead to arrhythmia

Lung Cancers
------------

General approach to lung parenchymal cancers

-   Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) vs Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

    -   Papillary Carcinoma of the Lung

-   If NSCLC: mets w/u to determine resectable or non-resectable

-   If SCLC: determine RT vs. no RT depending on limited or extensive disease (extending beyond 1 hemi-thorax)

### Mesothelioma

-   Complication: Compression of the lung

### Muciepidermoid carcinoma

-   Obstruction of the bronchus

Gastroenteric Cancers
---------------------

Upper GI

### Esophageal CA

infection from abcess formation

### Stomach CA

**GIST**

-   Diagnosis: c-KIT

### Colon CA



### Rectal CA

-   Often kills by hemorrhage because the tumor barrow through the intestinal wall.

Renal Cancers
-------------

Urological Cancers
------------------

### Prostate Cancer

Commonly are adenocarcinomas arising from peripheral zone of the gland

-   Presentation

    -   BOO: frequency, hesitancy, nocturia,

    -   Hematuria

-   PE:

    -   Digital rectal examination -- asymmetric nodular enlargement

-   Dx:

    -   PSA elevation

    -   Increased prostate acid phosphatase (advanced disease -- when tumor penetrate capsule)

    -   Increased alkaline phosphatase

-   Tx:

    -   

-   Px / Cx:

    -   Metastasize to bone and produce sclerotic lesion

    -   Post prostate / bladder surgery may be complicated with vesicoureteral reflux

### Testicular Tumor

Testicular Tumor Risk Factors The most common testicular tumor is germ cell tumor. The specific cause of germ cell tumors is unknown, but various factors have been associated with the increased risk.

Genetics play a role in testicular cancer risk. Klinefelter's syndrome (47xxy) is associated with a higher incidence of germ cell tumors. For first degree relatives of individuals affected there is approximately six to ten- fold increased risk for germ cell tumors. Other conditions such as Down syndrome, testicular feminizing syndrome, true hermaphrodites, persistent mullerian syndrome, and cutaneous ichthyosis are at higher risk for developing germ cell tumors.

Family history also plays an important role in testicular cancer risk. There have been reports of six-fold increased risk among male offspring of a patient with testicular cancer.

Patients with cryptorchidism have 20 to 40-fold increased risk compared with their normal counterparts. Cryptorchidism is the absence of one or both testes from the scrotum, usually as the result of an undescended testis.Orchipexy, even at an early age, appears to reduce the incidence of germ cell tumor only slightly.

Numerous environmental hazards, such as industrial occupations and drug exposures have been implicated in the development of testicular cancer. They include DES, Agent Orange, and solvents used to clean jets and ochratoxin A.

One to two percent of patients with testicular cancer will develop a second primary cancer in the contralateral testicle. This represents a 500-fold increase in risk compared with normal population.

Prior trauma, elevated scrotal temperature, and recurrent activities, such as horseback riding and motorcycle riding do not appear to be related to the development of testicular tumors.

Testicular tumor presents as scrotal mass that is rarely accompanied by tenderness.

The swelling is solid so should not transilluminate.

A testicular tumor is usually non-tender to palpation

Testicular cancer is the most common malignancy affecting males between the ages 15 and 35, although it accounts for only one percent of all cancers in men.

These tumors could present as a nodule or as a painless swelling of the testicle, 30-40% may present with dull ache or heavy sensation in the lower abdomen, perianal area, or scrotum areas. Acute pain is the presenting symptom in ten percent of cases.

There is no evidence to support routine screening for testicular cancer in asymptomatic adolescents and young adults.

Three Types of Testicular Tumors Germ cell tumor (GCT)

Seminomatous (SGCT)

Nonseminomatous (NSGCT)

Germ cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common-accounting for (95%) of primary testicular tumors-and are classified as either seminomas (45%) or others (50%), called nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, or NSGCT, based on histology.

Distribution of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs):

Embryonal cell tumor, the classic pure-cell NSGCT (20%)

Mixed GCTs (40%)

Teratomas and teratocarcinomas (30%)

Yolk sac tumors (also known as endodermal sinus tumors) are the most common prepubertal GCTs. They may be benign but are most often malignant. Most affected patients require surgery and chemotherapy because of the aggressive nature of the tumors, but the overall prognosis is excellent.

Choriocarcinoma is the most lethal but least common NSGCT (1%)

Non-germ cell tumors

Non-germ cell tumors (Leydig cell tumors and Sertoli cell tumors) constitute the remaining 5% of primary testicular tumors; these are rare tumors that are malignant in only about 10% of the cases.

Extragonadal

Lymphoma, leukemia, and melanoma are the most common malignancies that metastasize to the testicle (extragonadal tumors)
