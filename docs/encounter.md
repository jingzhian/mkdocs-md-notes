Informed Consent
----------------

A procedure consent form aims to aims to document adherence to one of the four principles of medical ethics: respect for autonomy. Patients can not be viewed as making their own autonomous decisions if they are not adequately informed as to the true nature of the decision. An autonomous decision to allow providers to perform a procedure requires an understanding of the the reason for the procedure, the nature of the procedure, as well as its risks, benefits, and alternatives.

Thus a consent form should include:

-   the name of the procedure

-   the diagnosis

-   the risks of the procedure

-   the benefits of the procedure

-   the alternative to the procedure that was proposed

Handling Tricky Clinical Situations
-----------------------------------

### Interviewing with Family Member Present

Benefits of Interviewing with Family Members

-   Family members can be a valuable source of information and can help in the implementation of and compliance with a treatment plan.

-   The presence of a family member strengthens the alliance between the physician and the patient without lengthening the office visit.

-   Family involvement may have a positive influence on medical encounters.

However, one need to be sensitive to special circumstances

-   Special attention should be given to privacy and confidentiality while interviewing an adolescent in the presence of a family member.

-   There may be ethical dilemmas involving confidentiality and privacy when family members are present with a patient of any age.

-   Family members might have additional questions or concerns about the patient's health.

-   There could be legal issues whenever a third party is involved to make financial and legal decisions for the patient, such as the mother of a child or the guardian of an adult who is impaired or has dementia.

Use the following techniques

-   Greet and build rapport

-   Identify each person's agenda

-   Check each person's perspective

-   Allow each person to speak

-   Recognize and acknowledge feelings

-   Avoid taking sides

-   Respect privacy and maintain confidentiality

-   Interview the patient separately, if needed

-   Evaluate agreement with the plan

Advanced family interviewing skills are useful in situations where the family exhibits ineffective communication, as a result of a conflict and intense emotions. The advanced family interviewing skills will help the family in communicating or managing conflicts to address the immediate patient care issues; however, unlike therapy, the use of these skills is not intended to create a permanent change in the family's interaction patterns. The physician may use reframing, decision analysis, criteria setting, and brainstorming to direct the interactions and conflicts, negotiate common ground, and, if needed, refer the family for more intensive family therapy. They include:

-   Guide communication

-   Manage conflict

-   Reach common ground

-   Consider referral for family therapy
