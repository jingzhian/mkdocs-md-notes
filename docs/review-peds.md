    -   Weakness of the deltoid and infraspinatus muscles (C5), biceps (C6), and wrist / finger extensors (C7) leads to predominance of the opposing muscles. The resulting appearance is the characteristic \"waiter's tip\" posture.

-   Treatment

    -   Observation and physical therapy - 80% have spontaneous recovery within 3 months

    -   Prognosis depends on if the damage resulted from mild nerve stretching or compression as opposed to severe rupture or avulsion.

    -   In patients who are not improving, may use MRI of the cervical spine to detect proximal nerve root avulsion, which typically requires surgical repair.

    -   Surgical intervention (e.g. nerve gradt, reconstruction, decompression) is considered for infants with no improvement by age 3 - 9 months but is not necessarily curative.

This is collagen defect disease with a spectrum of severity ranging from mild (type I), moderate (type III-IX), to severe (type II).

-   Presentation

    -   Type II is autosomal dominant due to defect in type I collagen synthesis that results in decreased bone density and increased skeletal fragility. Often found on antenatal U/S with multiple fractures, shortened femur, hypoplastic thoracic cage, and growth restriction.

Breast Feeding All vitamin are adequate through breast milk other than vitamin D and vitamin K Give Vitamin K as IM at birth All exclusively breastfed dark-skinned infants who are not exposed to ample sunlight should get Vitamin D

### Prematurity Problems

#### Intraventricular Hemorrhage

Originate from germinal matrix, a highly cellular and vascularized layer in subventricular zone from which neurons and glial cells migrate out during brain development, and contains numerous thin-walled vessels lacking glial fibers that support other blood vessels.

-   Presentation

    -   Most frequently in infants born before 32 weeks gestation (because germinal matrix become less prominent afterwards) and or with birthweight \< 1500g

    -   Hx of hemodynamic instability - premature infants have impaired autoregulation of cerebral blood flow

    -   Occurs within 5 postnatal days

    -   Can be silent or decrease consciousness, hypotonia, decreased spontaneous movements

-   Cx

    -   Long term neurodevelopmental impairment

Metabolic Diseases
------------------

### Childhood Obesity

For children and teens, BMI age- and sex-specific percentiles are used to interpret the BMI for two reasons:

-   The amount of body fat changes with age.

-   The amount of body fat differs between girls and boys.

Healthy is 5 - 85 th percentile, overweight is up to 95th percentile, and obese is higher than 95th percentile.

Nearly 17 percent of children and adolescents age two to 19 years are obese.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)

Endorse universal screening using body mass index (BMI) and use of BMI growth curves to identify obese and overweight children.

The United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF)

USPSTF has determined that there is fair evidence that body mass index (BMI) is a reasonable measure for identifying children and adolescents who are overweight or are at risk for becoming overweight. They have also determined that there is fair evidence that overweight adolescents and children aged 8 years and older are at increased risk for becoming obese adults.

The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen children aged 6 years and older for obesity and offer them or refer them to comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention to promote improvement in weight status (Grade of Evidence B).

Use the word \"unhealthy weight\" during weight counseling.

Increasing Pediatric Health Issues Type II diabetes has become more common among 6-19 year olds, comprising 8 to 45 percent of all new cases of diabetes.The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in persons younger than 20 years old is about 1 in 400.

Risk factors - BMI at or above the 85 percentile, an increased fasting glucose level of 100mg/dL, and an elevated fasting insulin level. Recommended screening - Screen all children at age 10 who have a BMI \>85 percentile and risk factors for diabetes or \>95 percentile without risk factors, rechecking every two years thereafter. High cholesterol (serum cholesterol levels greater than 200mg/dL) - has been found in 10 percent of children 2 to 19 years of age. This is higher than it was previously.

Risk factors - The strongest risk factor is elevated BMI. Recommended screening - Check a fasting lipid profile on every child with a BMI of \>85 percentile. The goal total cholesterol is 170 mg/dL. The goal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is 130 mg/dL. Treatment - Initial treatment includes diet and exercise. Drug treatment is recommended for children who have an LDL \>190 mg/dL or and LDL \> 160 mg/dL with risk factors. Drug treatment is only recommended for children who are older than 10 and who are either Tanner stage 2 (male) or have achieved menarche. Hypertension incidence in children has increased from 1-3

Risk factors - The strongest risk factor is obesity. Complications - Hypertension in children can lead to hypertension in adults and put them at risk for cardiovascular complications. Metabolic syndrome

Defined in adults as having at least three of the following, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, elevated fasting blood glucose levels, excessive waist circumference, or hypertension, affects 20 percent of adults ages 20 to 40, and 40 percent older than 40 years of age. They are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. While there is no agreed upon definition for metabolic syndrome in children, if we apply the diagnostic criteria to children, substituting elevated BMI for waist circumference, we have started to see increased rates in adolescents. Seven percent of overweight adolescents, 29 percent of obese adolescents, and 50 percent of severely obese adolescents meet the criteria for metabolic syndrome and will have increased health risks. Smoking also increases the risk of metabolic syndrome.

Other complications of obesity

Musculoskeletal disorders such as Blount disease (progressive bowing of the legs) or slipped femoral epiphysis (leads to hip or knee pain). Gastrointestinal problems including steatosis and gallbladder disease. New recommendations include screening for steatosis at age 10 if BMI is greater than 95 percentile, or if greater than the 84-94 percentile but with risk factors and every two years thereafter with an AST and ALT and refer to gastroenterology for levels that are twice the upper limit of normal. Gynecological problems including early menarche and polycystic ovary syndrome can also be seen in overweight females. Skin concerns such as acanthosis nigricans (darkening of the skin around the neck), and intertrigo (inflammation of skinfolds caused by skin-on-skin friction, initially presents as red plaques, almost in a mirror image, on each side of the skin fold) are more common among overweight children. Psychosocial problems including: stigmatization, bullying, low self-esteem, and depression. Obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, pseudotumor cerebri are also more common among overweight children.

Pediatric Weight Management Recommentation

1.  Prevention plus: starting place for all

2.  Structured weight management: if no improvement on prevention plus

3.  Comprehensive multidisciplinary intervention: if still obese

4.  Tertiary care intervention: if 6 - 18 year old

Children younger than 7 years old who have a BMI at or above the 95 percentile without secondary complications should attempt to maintain their weight. Those with complications should pursue weight loss until their BMI is at or below the 85th percentile. The general recommendation is about one pound per month. For overweight children over 7 years old, weight loss is recommended to achieve a BMI at or below the 85th percentile.

### Elevated Cholesterol

-   Diagnosis\
    The guideline for normal cholesterol is less than 170 mg/dl for total cholesterol and the goal LDL level is less than 130 mg/dl.

-   Management\
    Elevated cholesterol in children is a worsening problem, and the experts are still figuring out what is the best way of treating it.

    -   Children with a family history of high cholesterol or who are overweight or obese should have cholesterol checked.

    -   For children who have elevated cholesterol, the recommendation is to work on diet and exercise including referral to dietician.

    -   If LDL is greater than 190 mg/dl, initial recommendation is six months of diet and exercise treatment. If there is no improvement after six months and child is age 10 or older recommendation is to start treatment with a statin in discussion with the family. These children with LDL of greater than 190mg/dl it is likely they have a familial hypercholesterolemia and should be referred to a pediatric lipid specialist.

    -   For children who have other cardiac risk factors(ie. hypertension, Diabetes mellitus Type 1 or 2, Kawasaki disease) or family risk factors including cardiac event in male parent, grandparent, uncle less than age 55 or female parent, grandparent, aunt less than age 65 the decision could be made to initiate therapy at a lower LDL range.
