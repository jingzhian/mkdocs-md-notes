Gynecology
==========

General Concepts
----------------

### Development of the Germ Cell

-   5 month gestation: Primordial germ cells differentiate into oogonia (46,2N) and arrest in meiosis I

-   Follicular phase: Completion of meiosis I and halts in metaphase II (secondary oocyte)

-   Fertilization: Complete division

### Determination of Sex and Sexual Characteristics

-   Fertilization: Genetic sex is determined

-   Embryogenesis: Primary sexual characteristics

    -   Gonadal stage:

        -   Migration of primordial germ cells from near yolk sac to genital ridge forming primitive gonads consisting of germ cells, supporting cells, and steroidogenic cells

        -   SRY gene induce secretion of testosterone (Leydig) and mullerian inhibiting factors (Sertoli cells)

    -   Ductal stage:

        -   In male, MLF causes paramesonephric ducts regress while mesonephric duct develop into epididymis, ductus deferens and seminal vesicles.

        -   In female, mullerian ducts give rise to uterine tubes, uterus, cervix and upper vagina under influence of maternal estrogen and mesonephric ducts regress due to lack of hormonal stimulation

    -   Genital stage:

        -   Genital tubercle: glans penis in males and glans clitoris in females

        -   Urogenital folds: ventral aspect of penis in males and labia minora in females.

        -   Genital swellings: scrotum in male and labia majora in female

        -   Urogenital sinus:

            -   Male: give rise to bladder, urethra, prostate, bulbourethral glands

            -   Female: bladder, urethra, lower vagina and Bartholin glands

-   Puberty: Secondary sexual characteristics

    -   Fully developed secondary sexual characteristics implies normal estrogen and gonadotropins

    -   The first sign is

        -   testicular enlargement in boys

        -   brest enlargement in girls

    -   *Delayed puberty*: Absence or incomplete development of secondary sexual characteristics by *age 14 in boys* and *age 12 in girls*

### Basic Anatomy

Ovaries

-   Covered by mesovarium -- extends to form the broad ligament of the uterus

-   Uterine tube, ovarian ligament, round ligament of the uterus and a portion of suspensory ligament of the ovary are also surrounded by broad ligament

-   Nerves, arteries, veins and lymphatics supplying ovary are all delivered by suspensory ligament of the ovary

Relevant lymphatic drainage

-   Cutaneous LN from umbilicus to feet, external genitalia and anus up to pectate line external inguinal

-   Glans penis and cutaneous of posterior calf Deep inguinal LN external iliac nodes common iliac nodes

-   Inferior mesenteric nodes pre-aortic nodes

-   Testes para-aortic LN (note!)

-   Upper limb and breastInfraclavicular LN

Health Maintenance
------------------

### Influence of Anabolic Steroids

-   Testicular atrophy: High circulating androgen inhibit LH secretion decreased Leydig cells stimulation decreased local testosterone production resulting in

    -   Low sperm count

    -   Atrophy of seminiferous tubules

    -   Decreased testicular size

-   Erythrocytosis

-   Acne

-   Hepatic abnormalities

### HPV Vaccination 人类乳头状瘤病毒疫苗

-   Typically administered to those age 11 - 26 but can be given from age 9 - 45.

-   Offer catch-up vaccination for patients who are not vaccinated or did not complete the series

-   Previous or current HPV vaccination is not a contraindication to HPV vaccination because vaccination provides protection against other HPV types

### PAP smear 子宮抹片

-   Begins at 21 y/o in immunocompetent patients regardless of age of onset of sexual activity or number of sexual partners

-   F/U for PAP

    -   Atypical glandular cells:

        -   Colposcopy

        -   Endocervical currettage

        -   If age greater than 35 (or less than 35 but with risk factors e.g. obesity and anovulation), perform endometrial biopsy to evaluate ectocervix, endocervix, and endometrium, because these may be due to either cervical or endometrial adenocarcinoma

### Mammogram 乳房 X光检查

-   Calcifications on MMG is concerning because maglinant cell membranes become necrotic and calcify

Common Treatment
----------------

### Contraception

-   IUD is the most common form of contraception in the world; has increased risk of PID in the first 20 days of use, due to introduction of bacteria during insertion but not due to IUD itself. Expulsion rate is about 2 - 10 % and is increased in nulliparious woman.

-   Estrogen containing contraception is contraindicated in patients with migraine with aura due to the increased risk of stroke

-   Nonhormonal and progestin-only contraception methods are preferred in patients \<1 month postpartum and breastfeeding.

-   If patient miss contraceptive pill

    -   If NO intercourse in the past 5 days: two pill immediately and back-up method for 7 days

    -   If intercourse in the past 5 days: emergency contraception, restart pill immediately, and use backup for 5 days.

-   Emergency contraception: use less than 5 days after intercourse

    -   Progestin ECP - prevent 85%

    -   Combined ECP - prevent 75%

| Contraception | Features | Side effects |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------ |
|               |          |              |

Combined oral contraceptive & Can be used \>6 weeks postpartum while breastfeeding, can be used to control hypermenorrhea but irregular bleeding is also the most common reason for stopping& For patients who can reliably take daily medications; Side effect divided into estrogenic effects (nausea, breast tenderness, fluid retention) and androgenic effects (hair growth, male pattern baldness, nausea). Can result in increase in BP, discontinue if so, and BP is expected to return to baseline in 3 months; Also has three fold increase in risk of thromboembolic events -- [contraindicated in smokers more than 35 year old]{style="color: red"}\
Progestin-only pill & suppress ovulation, thicken cervical mucus, alter endometrium, inhibit tubal transport; effect dependent on consistency of use (alternative needed if late by more than 3 hours) & Increased change of ectopic pregnancy if user becomes pregnant\
GnRH agonist therapy & E.g. Leuprolide, treats heavy, regular menses by acting on the pituitary to decrease pulsatile FSH and LH release, thereby producing a hypoestrogenic state and amenorrhea. & Not recommended for long term use due to adverse effect such as decreased bone density, and is particularly avoided in patients at high risk of bone density abnormalities.\
Ulipristal & 0 -120 hr EC with efficacy of 98 - 99% & No contraindications\
Transdermal patch &&less effect in obese patients\
Depot-Medroxyprogesterone Acetate & Long term contraception, IM injection every 3 months & Weight gain is common, not recommended in patients with postpartum weight loss problem; Decrease in bone mass and shold not be used for more than 2 years; most common side effect is menstrual changes with amenorrhea in about 1 year;\
Progestin-releasing subdermal implant & A long-acting reversible contraceptive that reduces menstrual bleeding in 50% of patients and causes amenorrhea in 20% of patients. & Ideal for adolescents, particularly those who have difficulty with pelvic examinations\
Levonorgestrel containing IUD 子宮环 & Long-acting, reversible, lower risk of PID by thickening cervical mucus, good for 3 - 5 years & Amenorrhea - common and can be used to improve anemia and abnormal uterine bleeding; A small percentage of woman experience systemic SE inc mood changes, breast tenderness, headache\
Copper IUD & Highly effective! In emergency, use 0 - 120 hr, good for 10 years & Increase bleeding! - Not recommended in patients with heavy menses or anemia; also contra in acute pelvic infection, severe uterine cavity distortion, wilson disease, complicated organ transplant failure\

### Others

-   Tranexamic acid: Treat heavy menses in women for whom combined OCP is contraindicated

-   Endometrial ablation: Cauterize the endometrial lining, causing endometrial scarring and possible amenorrhea to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. Not appropriate for patients who wish to preserve fertility due to the risk of future obstetric complications such as placenta accreta

-   SSRI: First line for PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD); Diagnosis require 5 systemic symptoms.

    -   No other symptoms or nipple discharge

### Infiltrating ductal carcinoma / Ductal Carcinoma in Situ

Classically divided into 5 different subtypes: comedocarcinoma, solid, cribriform, papillary and micropapillary. Most cases have a mixture of patterns. The comedocarcinoma type has solid sheets of pleomorphic, high-grade cells w central necrosis, chronic inflammation, periductal concentric fibrosis.

-   Epidemiology

    -   1 in 9 woman in general population

    -   Modifiable risk factor: Alcohol consumption has a dose-dependent causal effect on breast cancer, nulliparity, HRT, increased age at first live birth

    -   Non-modifiable risk: Genetic mutation or breast cancer in first-degree relatives (breast cancer \< 50 y/o, ovarian at any age), white race, increasing age, early menarche or later menopause.

-   Presentation

    -   

-   PE:

    -   Dimpling or breast contour changes

-   Tx:

    -   DCIS is a premalignant lesion; but LCIS is associated with bilateral breast cancer so all patient will undergo bilateral mastectomy

### Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome

This is a rare but life-threatening complication of ovulation induction. Ovulation trigger agents (e.g. hCG injection) stimulate artificial maturation of multiple ovarian follicles in patients undergoing infertility treatment and can cause an exaggerated ovarian response (e.g. bilateral enlarged, cystic ovaries with multiple follicles), as well as overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), causing increased vascular permeability and capillary leakage. This causes massive extravascular fluid shifts (e.g. third spacing) and VEGF leakage into the intraperitoneal cavity, leading to ascites and abdominal distension.

-   Clinical features

    -   1 - 2 weeks after ovulation induction

    -   presents with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain

    -   pleural effusion results in tachypnea, decreased breath sounds

### Abnormal Uterine Bleeding / Irregular Menses

Defined as menstrual bleeding that is prolonged ($>$5 days) and heavy ($>$1 pad every 2 hours) with an irregular frequency. Chronic AUB can result in symptomatic **iron deficiency anemia**, which in turn can present as syncope, palpitation, and tachycardia. Gradual depletion of iron stores is evidenced by a low Hb level and decreased mean corpuscular volume.

#### Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis immaturity

Obstetrics
==========

### Pregnancy Complications - Child

#### Syphilis in Pregnancy

-   Screening

    -   Universal at first prenatal visit

    -   Third trimester and delivery (if high risk)

-   Diagnosis - Serology tests: can do either initially but confirm with the other

    -   Nontreponemal (RPR, VDRL)

    -   Treponemal (FTA-ABS)

-   Treatment

    -   Intramuscular penicillin G benzathine (1 dose weekly for 3 weeks)

    -   Patients who are allergic to penicillin need to be desensitized

-   Fetal effects

    -   Hepatic (hepatomegaly, jaundice)

    -   Hematologic (hemolytic anemia, platelets)

    -   Musculoskeletal (long bone abnormalities)

    -   Failure to thrive

-   Pregnancy effect

    -   Intrauterine fetal demise

    -   Preterm labor

#### Fetal Growth Restriction

Defined as an estimated fetal weight \<10th percentile for gestational age.

-   Diagnosis

    -   Symmetric: begins in first trimester and is due to fetal conditions such as aneuploidy, congential abnormalities, and intrauterine infections

    -   Asymmetric: occurs in second and third trimesters, due to maternal conditions that cause placental insufficiency (e.g. pregestational DM, HTN). The asymmetry is due to fetal redistribution of blood flow to vital organs (e.g. brain, heart, placenta) at the expense of less vital organs (e.g. abdominal viscera)

-   Management

    -   Weekly biophysical profile

    -   Serial umbilical artery Doppler sonography

    -   Serial growth ultrasounds

#### Fetal Macrosomia

An estimated fetal weight 4500g, typically occurs in patients with gestational DM, excessive pregnancy weight gain, and some syndrome (e.g. Beckwith-Wiedemann).

#### Fetal dysmaturity syndrome

Occurs in post-term ( weeks gestation) pregnancies due to age-related placental changes and resultant uteroplacental insufficiency. Neonates are small for gestational age, have a thin body with loose skin, and have meconium-stained amniotic fluid. This cannot happen in twins because they are delivered preterm or term.

#### Twin-twin transfusion syndrome

Unbalanced arteriovenous anastomoses present between shared placental vessels in monochrionic twins, resulting blood from the placental arteries of one twin (donor) to shunt into the placental veins of the other twin (recipient).

-   Presentation

    -   Donor: renal failure, oligohydramnios, low output heart failure, IUGR

    -   Recipient: polycythemia, polyhydramnios, cardiomegaly, high-output heart failure, hydrops fetalis.

-   Diagnosis

    -   U/S

    -   T-sign - single placenta and a thin intertwin membrane that meets the placenta at 90-degree angle. This is in contrast to fused dichorionic gestation which has a lambdo sign.

-   Complication: intrauterine and neonatal death

-   Management

    -   Mild: expectant with serial U/S to evaluate for worsening clinical features

    -   Moderate to severe case: treat with laser coagulation of placental anastomoses

#### Fetal Hydrops

Hydrops fetalis is a sequala of high output fetal heart failure characterized by excessive fluid accumulation in interstitial spaces.

-   Presentation

    -   Pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, ascites, skin edema, placental edema, polyhydramnios

-   Etiology

    -   Immune: Rh(D)alloimmunization - Rh(D)-negative mothers develop anti-D antibodies from delivering an Rh(D)-positive infant. In subsequent pregnancies, existing maternal anti-D antibodies attack Rh(D)-positive infant, causing severe anemia and fetal hydrops.

    -   Nonimmune:

        -   Parvovirus B19 (Most common infectious origin)

        -   Fetal aneuploidy

        -   Cardiovascular abnormalities

        -   Thalassemia (e.g. hemoglobin Barts)

#### Chronic fetal hypoxemia / Uteroplacental Insufficiency

Uteroplacental insufficiency can occur in late-term pregnancies ( weeks gestation) due to increased placental vascular resistance caused by age-related placental changes. Progressive placental dysfunction can cause central nervous system suppression and possible fetal demise. To prevent this suppression, blood is preferentially distributed to the brain rather than the peripheral tissue, resulting in decreased fetal activity. In the fetal kidney, the decreased renal perfusion and urine production results in oligohydraminos (single deepest pocket of amniotic fluid \<2 cm). During labor / contractions, decreased placental function reduces placental perfusion which can result in intermittent fetal hypoxemia, which presents as late decelerations.

-   Diagnosis: Biophysical Profile (BPP)

    -   Non stress test PLUS Ultrasound assessment of amniotic fluid volume and fetal activity

    -   Score is abnormal and suggests imminent risk of fetal demise.

#### Polyhydramnios

Defined as an amniotic fluid index cm or a single deepest pocket .

-   Decreased fetal swallowing: anencephaly, gastrointestinal obstruction (GI tract atresia)

-   Increased fetal urination: high cardiac output due to anemia or twin to twin transfusion syndrome

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Causes

    -   Esophageal / dupdenal atresia

    -   Anencephaly

    -   Multiple gestations

    -   Congenital infections

    -   Diabetes mellitus

-   Complications

    -   Fetal malposition

    -   Umbilical cord prolapse

    -   Preterm labor

    -   Preterm PROM

-   Treatment

    -   Indomethacin is COX inhibitor that reduces amniotic fluid volume by increasing prostaglandin synthesis, fetal renal blood flow, and fetal urine output. However, it is contraindiciated in patients at weeks gestation due to risk of premature fetal ductus arteriosus closure.

    -   Severe or symptomatic polyhydramnios at preterm gestation: amnioreduction

    -   Mild / symptomatic at term gestation: expectant management

#### Oligohydramnios

Defined as AFI \< 5cm due to increased fetal swallowing or reduced fetal urination.

-   Causes

    -   Preeclampsia

    -   Abruptio placentae

    -   Uteroplacental insufficiency

    -   Renal anomalies

    -   NSAIDs

-   Complications

    -   Meconium aspiration

    -   Preterm delivery

    -   Umbilical cord compression

#### Bilateral Renal Agenesis and Potter Syndrome

-   Presentation

    -   oligohydramnios or anhydramnios

    -   Potter Syndrome due to persistent oligohydroaminios

        -   Clubfeet

        -   Classical (Potter) facies consisting of nasal, ocular, ear and jaw deformities

        -   Pulmonary hypoplasia - fatal

            -   Swallowing amniotic fluid contributes to development and maturation of fetal lungs

            -   Respiratory failure and renal failure cause death within hours of birth in 100% of infants with bilateral renal agenesis

        Note that similar presentation from other etiology but bilateral renal agenesis is called Potter sequence

### Delivery

#### Trial of Labor

Contraindicated when

-   Classical cesarean delivery (vertical incision)

-   Abdominal myomectomy with uterine cavity entry (i.e. for removal of intramural or submucosal fibroids)

#### Intrapartum GBS prophylaxis

Indications for intrapartum prophylaxis

-   GBS bacteriuria or GBS urinary tract infection in current pregnancy (regardless of treatment)

-   GBS positive rectovaginal culture in current pregnancy

-   Unknown GBS status PLUS any of the following

    -   \<37 weeks gestation - immature fetal immune system

    -   Intrapartum fever - indicate potential intraamniotic infection

    -   Rupture of membranes for hours - opportunity for intraamniotic GBS proliferation

-   Prior infant with early-onset neonatal GBS infection

#### Rh(D) alloimmunization

Rh(D)-negative mothers develop anti-D antibodies due to pregnancy with a Rh(D)-positive fetus due to significant fetomaternal blood mixing. This affects future pregnancies with Rh(D)-positive fetus. The maternal antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells, leading to hemolytic disease of the newborn (i.e. hydrops fetalis).

-   Indications for prophylactic administration of anti-D immunoglobulin for Rh(D)-negative patients

    -   at 28 - 32 weeks gestation

    -   \<72 hours after delivery of Rh(D)-positive infant

    -   \<72 hours after spontaneous abortion

    -   ectopic pregnancy

    -   threatened abortion

    -   hydatidiform mole

    -   chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis

    -   abdominal trauma

    -   2nd and 3rd trimester bleeding

    -   external cephalic version

#### False Labor

-   Presentation

    -   Mild, irregular contractions

    -   NO cervical change

-   Management

    -   Nonstress test - evaluates for fetal acid-base status and risk for fetal hypoxmia

    -   With reactive nonstress test, discharge home with labor precautions

#### Preterm Labor

Regular contractions at \<37 weeks gestation that cause cervical dilation and/or effacement.

-   Risk factor

    -   History of preterm delivery - Greatest risk!

    -   Multiple gestation

    -   History of cervical surgery (e.g. conization)

    -   Advanced maternal age

    -   Iron deficiency anemia

-   Risk Evaluation

    -   Transvaginal ultrasound for measurement of cervical length in the second trimester; TVUS also look for other markers such as changes in the appearance of the cervix during the Valsalva maneuver

    -   Positive fetal fibronectin test close to term; note that these are high until 20 weeks gestation, low during the mid-second and third trimesters, and increase again at term, when contractions disrupt the decidual-chorionic interface.

-   Presentation

    -   Regular, painful contractions

    -   Cervical changes (dilation, effacement)

    -   Associated vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluid

-   Diagnosis: clinical

-   Tx: Progesterone can be used to prevent preterm labor but once it starts:

    -   Vaginal progesterone to maintain uterine quiescence if there is a short cervix cm without history of preterm labor)

    -   IM progesterone from second trimester with serial TVUS is there is a short cervix cm with a history of preterm labor; if TVUS indicate a short cervix, cerclage may be indicated

    -   Magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection (e.g. cerebral pulsy) (\<32 weeks);

    -   Tacolytics (\<34 weeks)

        -   Indomethacin is first line - risk oligohydramnios, closure of ductus arteriosus;

        -   Nifedipine - risk maternal hypotension / tachycardia

        -   Terbutaline - beta-2 adrenergic agonist; but risk neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and ileus

    -   Corticosteroids (e.g. betamethasone): decrease risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome

#### Active Phase Protraction

Defined as \<1cm cervical dilation in 2 hours during the active phase of labor (6-10 cm cervical dilation). Cephalopelvic disproportion, in which the fetal head is too large to fit through the maternal pelvis, is a common cause of labor protraction. Other risk factors include inadequate contractions, maternal obesity, and fetal malposition.

#### Second Stage Arrest of Labor

Defined as insufficient fetal descent after pushing for

-   hours if nulliparous

-   hours if multiparous

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Risk Factors

    -   Maternal obesity

    -   Excessive pregnancy weight gain

    -   Diabetes mellitus

-   Etiology

    -   Cephalopelvic disproportion

    -   Malposition

    -   Inadequate contractions

    -   Maternal exhaustion

-   Management

    -   Operative vaginal delivery

    -   Cesarean

#### Vasa previa

Placental blood vessels run in the membranes over the cervix. Should these vessels break during membrane rupture, fetal exsanguination can occur in minutes because bleeding is primarily fetal in origin.

-   Presentation

    -   **Painless** vaginal bleeding on membrane rupture

    -   Blood loss is transient and minimal

    -   Fetal bradycardia or sinusoidal heart rate tracing

-   Diagnosis

    -   Early cesarean delivery at 34 - 35 weeks

    -   If rupture of fetal vessel is suspected, emergency cesarean delivery is performed

#### Placental Abruption

Premature separation of placenta from the uterus.

-   Risk factor

    -   PPROM - decreased amniotic fluid volume lead to uterine decompression and shearing of maternal decidual vessels

-   Presentation

    -   Acute vaginal bleeding

    -   Abdominal and/or back pain

    -   Distended, firm /hypertonic uterus

    -   If there is concealed bleeding, uterine distension result in uterus that is larger than expected

    -   Low amplitude but frequent contractions

    -   Unlike uterine rupture, no loss of fetal station.

-   Complication

    -   Fetal hypoxia

    -   Material hemorrhage and DIC

#### Placental accreta

Uterine villi attach directly to the myometrium instead of the decidua.

    -   Prior dilation and curettage

    -   Maternal age \>35

-   Diagnosis

    -   Antenatal ultrasound: irregularity or absence of placental-myometrial interface and intraplacental villous lakes

    -   Clinically placenta does not detach from the uterus, resulting in cord avulsion and necessitates a manual extraction which is then complicated by placental adherence and severe hemorrhage.

-   Management

    -   Antenatally diagnosed placenta accreta is delivered by planned cesarean hysterectomy

#### Uterine Rupture

-   Risk

    -   Previous classical cesarean and myomectomy with uterine entry are contraindications to trial of labor. These patients should be delivered by cesarean by 36 - 37 weeks.

-   Presentation

    -   Focal intense constant abdominal pain prior to rupture

    -   Accompanied by hyperventilation, agitation, and tachycardia with imminent rupture

    -   Pain is relieved by rupture

    -   Resumes shortly after in a diffuse distribution

    -   Bleeding might be vaginal and/or intra-abdominal

    -   Fetal limbs may be palpable on abdominal examination and fetal heart tracings are usually abnormal (e.g. tachycardia and recurrent decelerations)

    -   Fetal part may retract (loss of fetal station) and is pathognomonic of rupture.

-   Treatment

    -   Emergency laparotomy to confirm diagnosis and expedite delivery

#### Uterine Inversion

An uncommon but potentially fatal cause of postpartum hemorrhage. It can result from excessive fundal pressure and traction on the umbilical cord before placental separation.

-   Risk factors

    -   Nulliparity

    -   Fetal macrosomia

    -   Placenta accreta

    -   Rapid labor and delivery

-   Presentation

    -   Lower abdominal pain

-   Management

    1.  Place two wide-bore IV lines

    2.  Administer crystalloid fluids and blood products

    3.  Manual replacement of the uterus; if failed, laparotomy.

    4.  Placental removal and uterotonic drugs after uterine replacement

#### Shoulder dystocia

Inability to deliver the fetal shoulders with usual obstetric maneuvers after the fetal head delivers. This is caused by impaction of the anterior shoulder behind the pubic symphysis. This is an obstetric emergency due to risk for neonatal brachial plexus injury, clavicular and humeral fracture, and if prolonged hypoxic brain injury and death.

-   Risk Factors

    -   Fetal macrosomia (weight \>4.5 kg) - Major risk factor

    -   Post term pregnancy ( weeks gestation)

    -   M- maneuvers

        -   Deliver posterior arm

        -   Rotate posterior shoulder (Woods screw) - apply pressure to anterior aspect of the posterior shoulder

        -   Adduct posterior fetal shoulder (Rubin) - apply pressure to the posterior aspect of the posterior shoulder

        -   Mother on hands and knees - all fours (Gaskin)

        -   Replace fetal head into pelvis for cesarean delivery (Zavanelli)
