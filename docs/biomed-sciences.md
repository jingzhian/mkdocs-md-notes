Essential Biomedical Sciences and Related Clinical Issues
=========================================================

This section covers principles that are useful across multiple specialities and form the basis of patient management.

Anatomy
-------

*Anatomy is closely linked to function; usually loss of function is associated with loss of anatomy.* Some treatments, especially in orthopedics the restoration of anatomy is the way to restore function.

-   Crazy number of cell types but only 5 Tissues Types

    1.  Epithelial

    2.  Connective

    3.  Muscle

    4.  Nerve

    5.  Blood

        -   RBC

        -   WBC: lymphocytes (T, B), neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes

        -   Plasma: proteins, lipids, electrolytes, glucose, urea, gases

-   Organs are composites of tissues\
    The layering is tissues is often typical: epithelial - **basement membrane** - connective tissue - muscularis mucosa - connective tissue with fat and blood vessel - muscular (maybe with vasa vasorum) - endothelium. *Differences between tissue arise because of different specializations of these layers, and espeically the epithelial.*

-   11 Human Organ Systems\
    Organs are arranged into organ systems. *One organ can belong to different organ systems depending on function being served.* For example, kidney is involved in the CVS by producing renin and EPO, it is involved in metabolism because of the effect on fluid status and acid-base balance etc.

    1.  Integumentary

    2.  Muscle

    3.  Skeletal

    4.  Nervous

    5.  Endocrine

    6.  Lymphatic

    7.  Cardiovascular

    8.  Respiratory

    9.  Digestive

    10. Urinary

    11. Reproductive

Following sections go through key clinically relevant anatomical structures.

Basic Biophysics
----------------

### Osmosis

Diffusion of solvent molecules into a region in which there is a higher concentration of a solute. Osmotive pressure depends on the number rather than type of the particles in the solution; The number of osmotivally active particle give rise to the activity of effective concentration of a fluid.

-   **Osmotic pressure** for **an idea gas** is given by the *general equation*: $$P = \frac{nRT}{V}$$

-   The **osmolal concentration** of **a substance in a fluid** is measured by the degree to which it depresses the freezing point in relation to an ideal fluid. Normal plasma osmolal concentration is 290 mOsm. Major contributor of osmolarity in the body are , , , glucose, and urea. Compute osmolality using the following equation $$\text{Osmolality} = 2 \ce{Na^+} + 0.055 \ce{Glu} + 0.36 \text{BUN}$$ (i.e. use sodium to account for the negative ions)\
    If the measured plasma osmolality greatly exceeds the value predicted by the above formulae, suspect presence of foreign substance such as ethanol, mannitol, or poisons such as ethylene glycol or methanol.\
    \
    Application

    -   Use osmolarlity to assess dehydration, overhydration, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities

    -   Hyperosmolar coma result from inability for cell to maintain osmolality and are damaged due to swelling.

### Diffusion

: the process by which a gas or a substance in solution expands, because of the motion of its particles, to fill all the available volume. The key equation to know is *Fick's law of diffusion)* $$J = - DA \frac{\Delta c}{\Delta x}$$

Also remember the *Donnan effect*, which describe the effect of non-diffusable ions on the distribution of other ions to which the membrane is permeable to. *Donnan and Gibbs equation* describes the phenomenon that in the presence of non-diffusable ion, the diffusible ions distribute themselves so that at equilibrium their concentration ratios are equal.

Only permeable ions determine the electrical potential across membranes - *Nernst equation* $$E_{\text{ion}} = \frac{RT}{FZ_{\text{ion}}} \ln \frac{\text{ion}_{\text{out}}}{\text{ion}_{\text{in}}}$$ Key ions we care about are with +60 mV, with -70mV, and with -90mV. When enters, leaves, and is neutral. Na-K-ATPase is a electrogenic pump that pumps 2 in and 3 out, thus keeping cell membrane potential negative.

Fluids
------

Approx 60% of total body weight is water:

-   2/3 intracellular: mostly skeletal muscle

-   1/3 extracellular: 1/4 intravascular (blood 4.5 - 5.5 litre), 3/4 in extravascular (i.e. 1:3 intra:extra)

### Fluid Replacement

When giving fluids, consider:

1.  Type of fluid to give

    -   If isotonic crystalloid solutions are used, redistribution of the infused fluid follow the 3:1 rule i.e. by 1-2 hours after 1-L infusion of isotonic saline or lactated Ringer's only approx. 250 mL remains in the intravascular compartment. Thus, 3 times of the vascular deficit should be administered.

    -   Colloid (containing high molecular weight molecules e.g. albumin, hetastarch, and dextrans) are more expensive than crystalloids but stay in the intravascular space longer.

        -   In edematous patients - 1% albumin solution can draw approximately 3 times its amount from the extracvascular compartment, thus reducing edema.

        -   Caution: starch is associated with increased tissue accumulation, leading to coagulopathy and renal failure.

2.  How much fluid to give

    -   Adequate fluid hydration: urine output $\geq 0.5$ cc/kg/hr and by measuring daily weight changes

    -   An uncomplicated patient NPO loses $\geq1$ L of fluid per day from sweat, respiration, urine, and feces.

3.  Monitor and replace electrolytes as necessary

### Water Intoxication

Increased water in the body resulting in hypotonic ECF and hence swelling of cells. This, when happens in the brain, can result in consulsions and coma, and leads eventually to death. Water intoxication happens when

-   Water intake exceeds 16mL/min

-   Water intake is not reduced after administration of exogenous vasopressin

-   Water intake is not reduced when secretion of endogenous vasopressin occurs in response to small non-osmotic stimuli such as surgical trauma

-   Administration of oxytocin after parturition can also lead to water intoxication if water intake is not monitored carefully

### Water Diuresis

Water diuresis typically happens by drinking large amounts of hypotonic fluids. It begins about 15 minutes after ingestion of water load and reaches its maximum about 40 minutes after.

### Edema

Defined as build up of body fluids within tissues, related to an increased leak from the blood and/or reduced removal by the lymph system. Treatment of edema is usually achieved with:

-   correct underlying disorder

-   restrict diet soldium

-   diuretic therapy

Electrolytes
------------

-   Salivary and colon secretions are high in K

-   Stomach, bile, and ileum secretions are high in Cl

-   Salivary, pancreas, bile, and ileum, are high in HCO3

Acid-Base Disorders
-------------------

Acidosis and alkalosis arise from changes in respiration or metabolic disturbances, result in deviation of body pH from the normal range of 7.35 - 7.45, and impact the delivery of and removal of . Metabolic acidosis/alkalosis can be due to electrolyte disturbances, severe vomiting or diarrhea, ingestion of certain drugs and toxins, kidney disease, and diseases that affect normal metabolism such as diabetes. Treatment include

-   correct underlying disorder

-   symptomatic treatment depend on type of disorder

    -   respiratory acidosis - restoring ventilation

    -   respiratory alkalosis - treat root cause

    -   metabolic acidosis - give bicarbonate

    -   metabolic alkalosis - some are chloride responsive, otherwise treat underlying disorder

Key chemical equation for buffering is *Henderson Hasselbalch Equation*: . Important buffers in the body are bicarbonate, phosphates, and proteins.

Blood Product Replacement
-------------------------

Important molecules
-------------------

-   Oxidation helpers:

-   Energy molecules: ATP, Acetyl-CoA

-   Nucleosides

    -   Used in DNA, RNA, , ATP etc

    -   Some absorbed from diet, mostly synthesized in liver

    -   Release when molecules break down, mostly reused, some excreted in urine

    -   Consists of:

        -   Purine: Adenine, Guanine, Hypoxanthine, Xanthine\
            Purines breakdown to form uric acid. Some other uric acid is synthesized directly from 5-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (5-PRPP) and glutamine. In kidney, uric acid is filterd (20% of excreted), reabsorbed, and secreted by tubules (80% of excreted) before being excreted in urine. Normal excretion on purine free diet is 0.5 g/day or normal diet 1 g/day. Normal blood uric acid level is about 4 mg/dL.\
            **Gout**: disease characterized by recurrent attacks of arthritis, urate deposit in joints, kidneys, and tissues, elevated blood and urine uric acid levels. Most often affected joint is the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe.

            -   primary gout: increased production due to enzyme abnormalities or decrease excretion due to selective deficit in renal tubular transport of uric acid.

            -   secondary gout: increased production or decreased excretion due to other disease process e.g. thiazide diuretics, renal disease, leukemia, pneumonia etc.

            Treatment of gout

            -   increase excretion: phenylbutazone, probenecid

            -   decrease production: allopurinol

            -   anti-inflammatory: NSAID, or if cannot be tolerated, colchicine

        -   Pyrimidine: Cytosine, Uracil, Thymine\
            Pyrimidines carabolized to $\beta$-amino acids; which unlike physiologically active amino acids; the latter are $\alpha$-amino acids. *Thus $\beta$-amino acids, especially $\beta$-aminoisobutyrate can be used as measure of DNA turnover.*\

The central dogma of biology and related concepts
-------------------------------------------------

-   Mitosis - Centrioles Replicate in G1, DNA replicate in S, Final growth in G2, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, cytokinesis.

    -   Ki-67 / MIB-I / Cyclin for detection of mitotic activity

-   Exons are parts of the gene that's translated and introns are not.

-   Transcription happen from 5' to 3'; with addition of 5' cap of 7-methylguanosine triphosphate and poly(A)tail at the 3' end. Introns are then removed by spliceosomes.

-   Arginine and histidine are conditionally essential and must be provided in diet during rapid growth.

-   Translation also occur in the 5' to 3' direction. It starts at AUG in mRNA for methionine and terminates on UGA, UAA, UAG.

-   Chaperone proteins ensure final conformation is good. Signal peptide binds to signal recognition particle (SRP) to lead the growing pepetide chain into the cavity of endoplasmic reticulum.

-   Unibinquitination usually marks the protein for degradation but not always; cytoplasmic proteins are degraded in protasomes, while membrane proteins are degraded in proteasomes and lysosomes.

Physiology
----------

### Renal Physiology

Kidney functions

-   Regulation of water homeostasis

-   Regulation of electrolyte composition

-   Regulation of extracellular volumn and thus blood pressure

-   Regulation of acid-base homeostasis

-   Excretion of metabolic waste products and foreign chemical

-   Role in glucose metabolism - gluconeogenesis (20% of liver), glucose reabsorption

-   Endocrine functions - kinins, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, erythropoietin, renin

Clinical measurements

-   Renal Blood Flow

    1.  Compute effective Renal Plasma Flow - measured using p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) $$\begin{aligned}
                    \text{ERPF} = \frac{U_\text{PAH} \dot{V}}{P_\text{PAH}} = \text{clearance of PAH}
                \end{aligned}$$ where $U_\text{PAH}$ is the concentration of PAH in urine, $\dot{V}$ is the urine flow, $P_\text{PAH}$ is the concentration of PAH in plasma.

    2.  Get actual renal plasma flow $$\begin{aligned}
                    \frac{\text{ERP}}{\text{Extraction Ratio}} = \frac{x}{0.9} = \text{Actual RPF}
                \end{aligned}$$

    3.  Calculate Renal Blood Flow $$\begin{aligned}
                    \text{Renal Blood Flow} = \text{RPF} \times \frac{1}{1 - \text{Hct}}
                \end{aligned}$$

-   Glomerular Filtration Rate $$\begin{aligned}
            \text{GFR} = K_f[(P_\text{GC} - P_T) - (\pi_\text{GC} - \pi_{T})]
        \end{aligned}$$ where $K_f$ is the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient, and is the product of the glomerular capillary wall hydraulic conductivity and the effective filtration surface area.

Immunology
----------

### Selective IgA Deficiency

Genetically unable to synthesize lgA for either serum or bodily secretions due to failure of B cells to differentiate into IgA producing plasma cells.

-   Epidemiology: Relatively common condition especially in Caucasians

-   Presentation: Mostly asymptomatic, 5% presents with recurrent respiratory tract infections

-   A/W: Urticaria

Nutrition and Metabolism
------------------------

-   Carbohydrates **Galactosemia** is the congential deficiency of galactose 1-phosphate uridyl transferase for coverting galactose 1-phosphate into UDPG. This results in accumulation of galactose in the circulation and disturb growth and development

    -   Galatose-free diet; ok because UDPG can be converted to diphosphogalactose in the body

-   Fatty acids and lipids

    **Ketoacidosis**: occurs when there is an accumulation of excess acetyl-CoA which condense into acetoacetyl-CoA, that forms acetoacetate in liver, overwhelms the ability of the body to oxidize ketones, and results in accumulation of ketone in blood. This can happen due to reduced entry of acetyl-CoA into citric acid cycle such as when there is reduced product of glucose metabolism e.g. starvation, DM, high-fat and low carb diet. The ketones, acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid are anions of strong acids. They can act as buffers but when overwhelming about the ketosis is present, the pH can reduce resulting in metabolic acidosis which can be fatal.

    -   Parenteral adminitration of small amount of glucose

    **Carnitine deficiency** or genetic defects in the translocase or toher enzymes involved in the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria reult in deficient $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids, and cardiomyopathy. When fasted, patients with this condition can enter a hypoketonemic hypoglycemia coma, where glucose is used-up quickly but there is no ketone body being formed because of a lack of CoA in liver.

    **Cholesterol** Normal range for plasma cholesterol is 120 - 200 mg/dL. There is a clear, tight, positive correlation between cholesterol level above 180 mg/dL and ischemic heart disease in men. LDL delivers cholesterol to peripheral tissues, including atheromatous lesions, HDL picks up cholesterol from peripheral tissues and return them to liver. Patients with *familial hypercholesterolemia* have various loss-of-function mutations in LDL receptors.

    **Prostaglandins** play a prominent role in the genesis of pain, inflamation, fever, especially those synthesized by COX 2 but not COX 1. The latter protect the gastrointestinal mucosa from ulcrations. Leukotrienes also mediate allergic responses and inflammation. Their release is provoked when specific allergens combine with IgE antibodies on the surfaces of mast cells. They result in bronchoconstriction, constriction of artioles, increased vascular permeability, attract neutrophils and eosinophils. They are implicated in astham, psoriasis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, allergic rhinitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis.

    -   Glucocorticoids inhibit phospholipase A2 to inhibit formation of all eicosanoids

    -   NSAIDS (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen, indomethacin) inhibit both cyclooxygenases to inhibit production of PGH2 and its derivatives

    -   Selective COX2 inhibitors (celecoxib and rofecoxib) can relieve pain and inflammation without as much GI side effect. However they are associated with increased risk of stroke and heart-attachs.

Cancer Biology
--------------

-   Primary tumor is different from secondary tumor in the process of metastasis the primary tumor losses some of it's original phenotype and gain secondary features; not all tumors are the same even if from the same source

-   Difference between sarcoma and carcinoma the latter need EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition) to metastasis but not the former; different tumor behavior means one need to think of different ways in order to treat these tumors; think about initial ability of the cells and what they can do.

-   Cancer immunity assumes that only those escaping the immuno survillance can survive.

-   Value of surgery in cancer has to be defined differently from medicine; Patient selection is important and where surgery can benefit has a boundary; need to consider what is the difference between doing surgery to cancer vs. doing medical therapy

    -   can it be cut or not?

    -   is the problem now the tumor burden vs. survival

    -   would there be benefit to surgical methods that tackles micromets?

    -   Lymphatics based therapy for tumor spreading mainly via lymphatics?
