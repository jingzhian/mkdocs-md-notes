Basic Principles of Clinical Medicine 
-------------------------------------

-   Dangerous things are dangerous, common things are common

-   Multiple conditions may co-exist, and contribute to each other, e.g. PAD and cellulitis 2/2 foot ulcer; therefore do not over simplify, especially if there is a mixed picture

-   Disease is a function of the condition and patient.

### Biopsychosocial Approach to Care

The term *biopsychosocial* indicate an approach to health service delivery that addresses the psychological and social aspects of health and treatment, that includes behavioral and environmental issues. Intervention that considers biopsychosocial issues related to health requires the use of a transdisciplinary team of professionals to address medical problems and concerns in a variety of settings. Note that besides all medical specialities, nurses, pharmacists, social works, administrators, therapists, and health aids, family members are also increasingly recognized as part of a multidisciplinary team.

Evidence in support of biopsychosocial approach to care
-   Among people with cardiovascular disease, untreated depression has been found to increase the risk of a heart attack (Monster, 2004)
-   After a major medical procedure, such as open heart surgery, a patient's anxiety may increase (Ben-Zur, 2000)
-   A person who is depressed may be less motivated to f/u with medical appointments, and cope poorly with his diagnosis and treatment regimens, further adversely impacting his physical health (Livneh, 2000)
-   Effective coping, enhanced self-efficacy, and optimism have been associated with enhanced quality of life in people with chronic illnesses (Rose, 2002)

### Chronic Diseases

Chronic diseases can be categorized according to

-   Four key dimensions that have an impact on the family system (Rolland (1994)):

    1.  onset - family adapt differently when the onset is rapid vs. gradual

    2.  course - progressive, constant, improves over time, or fluctuating

    3.  outcome - fatal OR lifespan reduction but nonfatal; nonfatal conditions do not have neither a predictable timeline of demise nor a strong likelihood that they will emerge as the principal cause of death; fatal disease require more direct confrontation with high likelihood of death, calling for particular adaptive demands by the affected individual and the family system that are a part of the death and dying process.

    4.  degree of incapacitation

-   Distinct psychosocial typologies, each with its own set of implications for the adaptation and social functioning of the family system. These depend on the interaction between the 4 dimensions of a disease

Domains of Impact of Chronic Disease on Family

-   Chronic disease affects the family system's instrumental functions as a social unit to meet

    -   Economic needs

    -   Developmental and emotional needs

    -   Physical needs - primary care and support system for ill and disabled

-   They can also affect the family's functioning in

    -   Structural and organizational patterns

    -   Communication processes

    -   Multigenerational patterns

    -   Family life cycle and belief systems

Although the importance of family involvement in the process of health care delivery is recognized, there is still little knowledge about which particular attributes of family involvement are efficacious in improving health outcomes (IOM, 2008).


Safety in the Clinical Setting
----------------------

### Infection Control

Hospital acquired infection: infection not present before coming to the hospital but developed while in the hospital.

#### Modes of Transmission

Microorganisms are spread primarily through three ways within a hospital setting

1.  Airborne: occurs when infectious pathogens are aerosolized and remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. e.g. TB, chickenpox, measles

2.  Droplet: occurs when droplets containing microorganisms from the infected person are propelled a short distance through the air and deposited on the susceptible host's conjunctivae, nasal mucosa, or mouth. E.g. repiratory tract infections, influenza, mumps, rubella, MRSA respiratory disperser, Neisseria Meningitis

3.  Contact: there are two forms of contact transmission
    -   Direct transmission: involves physical contract between an infected person and a susceptible person
    -   Indirect transmission: involves contact of a susceptible person with a contaminated intermediate object
    Examples: MRSA, VRE, clostridium difficle


#### Identifying Patient's Precaution Status 

Method of identifying infectious patients in SGH

-   Coloured discs: [multi-drug resistant organism]{style="color: orange"} and [clostridium difficile, norovirus]{style="color: green"} patients are identified by orange / green discs on their medical records.

-   Precaution status can also be seen on Sunrise Clinical Manager (SCM), outpatient appointment system (OAS), and systems, applications and products (SAP) electronic systems.

#### Eliminate Transmission

**Standard Precaution**

-  What does it do
    - Reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from both recognised and unrecognized sources of infection in hospital
    - Apply to ALL patients receiving care in hospitals regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infection status.

-   When is it used?
  
    These are applied when one has contact with blood, non-intact skin, body fluids, mucous membrane

-   How

    -   5 Moments of Hand hygiene: Moments of hand hygiene (WHO)

        -   Inpatient
            1.  Before touching a patient
            2.  Before clean / aseptic procedure

          - Perform hand hygiene before donning on gloves
          - Ensure that the gown's flaps overlap and fully cover the inner clothing. Ensure that the gloves overlap with the cuffs of the gown.The white part is only cotton and NOT waterproof
        - Eye Protection
          - Protect healthcare worker's mucous membrane of eyes from contact with blood and body fluid
          - The eye protection should be fit well
          - If it is a reusable eye protection, clean and disinfect in between
  
      - Preparation and administration of drugs
        - Use aseptic technique to avoid contamination of sterile products
        - Never re-use devices
          - Vacutainer: rubber shield contains needle

Clinical Reasoning
------------------

*Clinical reasoning is the process, by which a health care provider takes objective data, acquired from an actual patient, and interprets it from factual knowledge from a textbook or the medical literature in order to either make a diagnosis or develop a treatment plan.* 

It isn't a single skill but rather a collection of related skills including

-   Interpretation of subjective data
-   Evaluation of the accuracy and validity of data
-   Synthesis of individual pieces of data into higher order groups
-   Determination of the relevance of scientific literature for a specific clinical situation
-   Critical evaluation of the arguments for and against diagnoses
-   Application of biostatistics
-   Integration of different types of knowledge into a complete decision-making process.

### Generating a Differential Diagnosis

A differential diagnosis is a list of possible diagnosis which may explain the patient's presentation. It should

-   Include those diagnoses in which either the likelihood is high enough or the danger, if it should be missed is high enough, in order to warrant additional testing to investigate that specific diagnosis.
-   It may include additional diagnoses whose likelihood is low enough to not warrant immediate testing, but which have not been completely ruled out
-   It is prioritized in descending order of likelihood.
-   Unlike a framework / approach, *the differential diagnosis is specific to the patient while the framework (or approach) is not*
-   Note atypical presentations!

A solid focused differential diagnosis should include

-   The one diagnosis that you believe to be the most likely - the \"working diagnosis\", or \"provisional diagnosis\"
-   2 - 4 diagnosis that are very common in general, for which this patient case could be either a typical or an atypical presentation
-   Any diagnoses which are rapidly fatal if untreated, of which this patient case could plausibly be a result - a \"don't miss diagnosis\"
-   Any diagnoses which are specifically suggested by standout features of the patient's history - most of these will turn out to be \"red herrings\"

Generating a list of differentials consists of 5 steps as outlined in the following subsections.

#### Acquire Data

-   Sources can include: Previous charts, Hx, PE, Tests, Talking to family and friends for collateral information etc.

-   More mature clinicians can dynamically identifying differential diagnosis as data collection is going on; this helps them select the necessary lab tests. However it does not always result in a more accurate diagnosis. In particular, such a process can set one up for **Anchoring Bias**. *This is the tendency to place too much weight on a single piece of information acquired early in the data acquisition process, and a failure to update the differential diagnosis when conflicting information is later presented.* Be aware of this bias, once all data is acquired, force myself to return to the beginning of the clinical reasoning process so that each piece of data is given equal weight.

#### Identify Key Features

Key features are individual elements of the presentation which are likely to help differentiate one diagnosis from another.

-   This include both positive and negative findings

-   May be from history, exam, labs, other tests, or chart review

#### Create a problem representation / summary statement / impression 

This is a 1 - 2 sentence summary, using precise medical terminology, of the most highly relevant aspects of the patient's history, exam, and diagnostic tests.\
\
Now consider using the following structure for the problem representation:

1.  Age and gender

2.  Highly relevant PMH

    -   multiple cardiovascular risk factors: HTN, diabetes, obesity, smoking
    -   multiple psychosocial stressors
    -   alcohol use
    -   40 pack year smoking history
    -   previously healthy
    -   significant sun exposure

3.  Primary symptom using semantic qualifiers\
    Semantic qualifiers are qualitative abstraction of the signs and symptoms of a case in which an opposing abstraction is either explicit or implied. These help to reframe a patient's symptom into terms more familiar to the clinician and easier to communicate to others. Common categories of qualifiers include:

    -   **Onset**: abrupt or progressive
    -   **Duration**: acute or chronic
    -   **Course**: continuous or episodic
    -   **Site**: unilateral or bilateral, proximal or distal, diffuse or localized
    -   **Symptom trigger**: Post-prandial, exertional, pleuritic, or positional
    -   **Presence of pain**: painful or painless

    Note that some information is lost when patient's presentation is translated into semantic qualifiers, which can set one up for bias if the original history is never revisited.

4.  Summarize highly relevant diagnostic data, especially the ones directly relevant to the chief complain. Synthesize constellation of clearly related findings into a single clinical syndrome when possible

    -   **Hemodynamically stable**: unremarkable vitals
    -   **Without evidence of acute infarction**: lack of Q waves or lack of ST segment elevation, normal cardiac enzymes.
    -   **SIRS**: elevated WBC, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea
    -   **ARDS**: acute onset dyspnea, bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary edema detected on CT or CXR, PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 300 mmHg
    -   **Peritoneal signs**: soft abdomen and lack of rebound tenderness
    -   **Hepatic failure**: 
    -   **Volume overload**: peripheral edema, dyspnea, abdominal distention, fatigue, and lassitude

    Don't mis-interpret the clinical syndrome for the diagnosis! e.g. sepsis is not a diagnosis, find the cause of the sepsis.

Examples of representation:

-   A 60 year woman with a history of poorly controlled diabetes, presents with chronic progressive exertional dyspnea, with exam and CXR findings of volume overload, and with unremarkable routine labs and EKG.

-   A 54 year male without health concerns or known medical problem presents for routine physical examination after not engaging with regular healthcare for over a decade. He is overweight and his blood pressure is elevated today, but the remainder of his physical exam is unremarkable. He has some cardiovascular risk factors including physical inactivity due to his work as a taxi driver, regular intake of fast food, and mother with hypercholesteronemia. His father had a MI at age 64, though this does not conferr significant risk to this patient, and he has some financial stressors and does not have health insurance.

-   Marissa is a 12-year-old female with a three-day history of fever, cough, sore throat, myalgia, and headache. Physical exam shows diffuse rhonchi, occasional wheezing, a hyperemic oropharynx, tender cervical lymphadenopathy, but no crackles. She missed her influenza immunization.

-   Sarah is a 24-year-old female with a family history of migraines who presents complaining of two types of chronic, progressively worsening headaches. The first type are severe, throbbing, and unilateral with associated nausea, photophobia, and hyperacusis, last all day when present, occur one- to two- times weekly, are worse prior to menses, and do not improve with ibuprofen. The second type are mild-to-moderate and bilateral, last all day most days, and have associated neck discomfort. On exam Sarah is afebrile with normal vital signs, has a mildly tender occiput, and has no focal neurologic defects, signs of increased intracranial pressure, or meningeal irritation.

-   Andrew is a sexually active 17-year-old male who presents with a four-hour history of severe right groin pain with radiation to the right scrotum and associated nausea but no vomiting, fever, or urinary symptom. The patient reports a similar episode six to nine months ago that resolved spontaneously. Physical exam finds a swollen, erythematous right scrotum with an exquisitely tender right testicle, no masses, a negative Prehn sign, an absent cremasteric reflex on the right, absent blue dot sign, and no transillumination of the scrotum. iMr. Barley is a 58-year-old male smoker who presents with a two-week history of productive cough and dyspnea on exertion. He has had similar symptoms during the past two winters. He denies fever, chest pain, epigastric pain, symptoms of CHF, recent travel, or TB or chemical exposures.

-   Mr. Marshall is a 72-year-old man, with a history of hypertension, COPD and moderate dementia, who presents with 4 days of increased confusion, nighttime restlessness, visual hallucinations, and urinary incontinence. His physical exam is unremarkable except for tachypnea, a mildly enlarged prostate, inattentiveness, and a worsening of his MMSE score from a baseline of 18 to 12 today.

-   Mrs. Saleh is a 28-year-old woman with a recent upper respiratory infection who presents with acute onset constant, non-positional vertigo with associated nausea and vomiting. On exam she has normal orthostatic vital signs, normal hearing, a positive Romberg test, and left horizontal nystagmus that resolves with gaze fixation and does not change with direction of gaze.

#### Adopt a Framework / Approach

To help better understand the patient's problem. This may be anatomic, physiologic, or other, commonly adopted from a referenced text. 

#### Apply the Key Features to the Framework to Generate Preliminary DD

The idea is to use the presence or absence to estimate the likelihood of the diseases suggested by the framework.



History Taking
----------------

### Obtaining Sexual History 

It is necessary to ask very personal questions when taking a sexual history. It is wise to warn the patient that you are going to ask these questions and to explain why they are necessary.
The prime consideration for patients is CONFIDENTIALITY and the reluctant patient may be more forthcoming when reassured of this by the physician. Moralistic attitudes should never be adopted, except perhaps towards the “repeater” or “defaulter” who continually puts both his/her own health and the health of others at risk.
Questions should also be phrased in a language that the patient will understand i.e. non- technical, and terms may need to be phrased in “street language”.

We ask questions to find out –
- risk of exposure to certain infections
- sites of exposure to infection (so we know where to take samples from)
- contact tracing – is it possible to contact the sexual contacts to advise them to
seek tests and treatment

Golden rules for taking a sexual history –
- assume nothing
- demonstrate that you have heard it all before
- never look shocked or surprised
- do not appear judgemental

Difficulty is often encountered in establishing the patient’s sexual orientation. It is naive to assume that a married man, perhaps with children, would not have indulged in homosexual activity. Unambiguous direct questioning is often necessary, again followed by further explanation if needed. Indeed all physicians should be aware of the spectrum of human sexual behaviour.

It is not sufficient merely to ask whether the patient has noticed any “troubles” or “symptoms”. A negative reply may be an important “negative” and should be substantiated by a properly taken history.

When syphilis or other systemic infections are suspected, the history must be more comprehensive and direct questions asked about each system.

Take the opportunity to do some health promotion. The majority of patients know very little about STIs/HIV.

#### Points in Sexual History Taking
- Age
- Sex
- Presenting complaints (see below under male and female)
- Last sexual contact (LSI)
  - When
  - With whom (regular/casual)
  - Type of sex (oral/vaginal/anal)
  - Condoms? Accidents (such as condom breakages)?
- Previous sexual contact (PSI) with a different individual from the last sexual contact
  - as above
  - avoid tactless inquiry into sexual history in “marital” cases when the source of the partner's infection is clear
- HIV – previous tests and risk factors
- Past history of other STI and treatment
  - Have you had any sexually transmitted infections in the past or sought advice for suspected infection?
  - In females include details of presumptive cystitis, thrust etc, treated by other practitioners
- Past medical history/drug allergies
  - Have you ever had any illnesses or operations requiring hospital admission? Record details

#### Males 
Discharge
- Have you noticed any discharge/pus coming from your penis? If “yes” record details, including:
    - Do you think it is coming from the urethra or under the foreskin?
    - How long have you had it?
    - What colour is it?

Urinary Symptoms
- Have you had any problems passing urine? If “yes” record details, including:
    - Is there a burning sensation?
    - Are you going more often?
    - Are you passing blood?
  
Genital Lesions
- Have you noticed any sores, spots or irritation on or near your penis? If “yes” record details, including:
    - Whereabouts?
    - For how long
    - Any symptoms such as pain or itch?
    - Have you had anything similar before?
    - What, if any, medicaments have you applied?

Other Symptoms
- Have you noticed any aching or swelling in your joints or pain or redness in your eyes?
- Have you ever had infectious hepatitis / yellow jaundice?
  (Particularly important to ask drug addicts and homosexuals about this as such patients are more likely to be carrying hepatitis B surface antigen than are other categories of patient)
- Are you allergic to any medicines?
- Are you currently, or have you recently, taken any antibiotics or other medicines?

#### Female
This should follow the same format as that adopted for males, but with certain modification in regard to symptomatology and female physiology.

Discharge
- Have you noticed excessive vaginal discharge? If “yes” record details, including:
    - What colour is it?
    - Does it cause irritation or itch?
    - Is it foul smelling?
    - Is it blood-stained?
    - (If long-standing) is it related to periods?
  
Urinary Symptoms
- Have you noticed any burning sensation passing water? As for males, but if “yes”
- Do you think the burning is caused by the urine coming out, or by urine coming into contact with inflammation on the outside? (external or vulval dysuria)
- Also enquire about urgency, loin pains, fever and rigors. (Suggestive of pyelonephritis secondary to urinary infections)

Genital Lesions
- Have you noticed any sores, spots or irritation in your genital area? Details as for males

Menstrual History
- What was the date of the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP)?
- Was this period “normal” for you? If not, was it heavier (menorrhagia)? Lighter (oligomenorrhoea)?
Record details of preceding period (s) as indicated
- Have you noticed any bleeding after intercourse (post-coital bleeding – PCB) or
any bleeding in between your periods (intermenstrual bleeding IMB)?

Gynaecological and Obstetric History
- Are you or your partner using any form of contraception? Eg oral contraceptive (OC), intrauterine device (IUD), diaphragm, sheath, pessaries, “rhythm” method etc.
    - If a barrier method is employed – is it always, usually or occasionally used?
    - If taking OC have any pills been missed?
- Have you ever been pregnant?
If “yes” record details – can use GxPx format
Patients may sometimes misunderstand the question to mean how many children they have. It is important to ask for number of pregnancies and number of live births. This may reveal a past history of failed pregnancy such as termination of pregnancy, spontaneous abortion or ectopic pregnancy.
- Have you had any tummy pains recently other than you would expect with your periods?
- Do you suffer from pain on intercourse?
If “yes” record type (superficial or deep), frequency (always or occasionally), duration (eg 1 week, 3 months or always)
- Have you had any gynaecological problems in the past?
(Eg Laparoscopy for suspected ectopic pregnancy 2 years ago)
- Have you had a (cancer) pap smear test before? If yes, when was the most recent one, and what was the result
- Have you had vaccination against the human papilloma virus (Cervarix / Gardasil)?


Physical Examination
--------------------

### STI patients

There are two essentials – first privacy for the patient, and secondly a good source of light for the doctor.

It is rarely practicable to perform a full physical examination on all patients, but in certain circumstances, such as when **Syphilis, Reiter’s disease, disseminated gonococcal infection or HIV infection** is suspected a thorough general examination is indicated.

In all cases, however, a meticulous examination of the genitalia and anal region should be performed. However, it takes very little additional time to inspect the skin and mucous membranes (eyes and mouth) and to check for the presence of generalized lymphadenopathy.

#### Genital Examination in Males
The genitalia should be fully exposed with both trousers and underpants fully dropped or preferably removed.

First inspect the inguinal region and then palpate it for evidence of lymphadenopathy - the distribution, consistency and tenderness of any nodes should be noted. At the same time closely inspect the pubic area and surrounding exposed skin for evidence of pediculosis, folliculitis or other skin lesions.

Next palpate the spermatic cord on both sides between the thumb and index finger. Although it may be difficult to discern the individual components, take note of any undue tenderness, thickening or asymmetry. The vas deferens may readily be palpated separately, but in patients who have had a vasectomy, ill-defined nodular thickening may be apparent.

The scrotum should then be inspected for asymmetry, erythema and superficial lesions (eg scrotal cysts, varicocoele) and the scrotal contents palpated (carefully!) for abnormality of the testis or epididymis. Slight variation in testicular size is common, but if marked variation is apparent, enquiry into past trauma, surgery or infection (eg mumps orchitis) may provide the reason for such discrepancy. If the scrotal contents seem enlarged and are difficult to discern on palpation transillumination may support the diagnosis of a hydrocoele.

Finally, attention should be directed to the penis itself, which first should be inspected from base to tip noting any abnormalities. The patient should then be asked to retract his foreskin (if present) as far back as it will go, and the subpreputial area inspected for evidence of balanitis, posthitis or any other abnormality. Special care should be taken that the entire circumference of the coronal sulcus is visualized. In patients with phimosis, especially of recent onset, careful palpation may reveal tenderness or induration under the foreskin.

While the foreskin is retracted inspect the external urinary meatus for evidence of meatitis, urethra should be “milked” gently by the examiner or patient. Examination of the inside of the front of the underpants may also provide evidence supportive of a urethral discharge.

The perianal region should also be examined (the patient is asked to bend over forwards and separate his buttocks), especially when there is a genital fungal infection or warts. These conditions often spread to this area and may be asymptomatic.

Both perianal and proctoscopic examination are essential in passive homosexuals. Proctoscopy may be performed in either the left lateral or knee-elbow position.

#### Genital Examination in Females
This is most easily performed with the patient in the lithotomy position.

Understandably, many women find this position and the genital examination embarrassing and uncomfortable. Moreover, time spent waiting in a half-undressed state increases anxiety, which makes the examination more difficult and time-consuming.

The inguinal region and surrounding area should first be examined first as in the male, and then attention focused on the external genitalia and introitus. Wipe off any discharge with cotton wool, and gently separate first the labia majora and then the labia minora to exclude any labial erythema, oedema, fissuring or vulval lesions. At the same time palpate to assess any enlargement of Bartholin’s glands, and inspect their ducts for evidence of discharge. The buttocks should then be separated for inspection of the perianal region.

Next, after forewarning the patient, introduce a bivalve speculum (warmed under the tap if necessary). After passing of the speculum, visualize the cervix first and then take a sample for the appropriate test.

The appearance of the cervical epithelium, any abnormality and the presence or absence of any cervical exudates (eg purulent, mucopurulent, clear) should be recorded, as should the presence of the IUD thread. Withdraw the speculum carefully and inspect the walls of the vagina (cleaned with cotton wool if necessary) for lesions.

The urethra is best examined after removal of the speculum. Urethral tests are taken at the same time, and particular note should be made of any discharge.

Finally, a bimanual examination should be done, both to assess the size of the uterus and to detect the presence of any abnormalities in the adnexae. Rocking of the cervix (“cervical excitation”) is a useful test in the diagnosis of salpingitis.

Patient Counselling
----------------------

### Motivational Interview 
Stages of change | Provider Task
|-----|-------
Precontemplation | Education about the health area
Contemplation | Cost-benefit analysis; develop discrepancy between patient goals and current behavior
Preparation | Brainstorm options; assist in developing a concrete action plan
Action | Encourage tracking/monitoring actions; validate patient and provide feedback; discuss and elicit social support
Maintenance | Check progress; troubleshoot slips / concerns of the patient; reinforce successes and build patient confidence
Addressing relapse or relapse prevention | Judge choices; not the patient; focus on past success; identify new supports that reinforce healthy behavior

Effective brief intervention for lifestyle change should be:
-   Patient-focused
-   Health-connected
-   Behavior-oriented
-   Realistic
-   Controllable
-   Measurable
-   Practical

Clinical Criteria
-----------------

### List of useful criteria

Criteria | Use Case
|---|---
[Pooled Cohort Equations 10 year ASCVD risk](http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator-Plus/#!/calculate/estimate/) | ASCVD risk
| AUDIT-C | alcohol use: 14/week or 4/day for men 7/week or 3/day for women
Wagner Grading System | Foot ulcers
| Curucao criteria | For diagnosing hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or Osler–Weber–Rendu disease
| Ottawa Knee Rules | determine the need for X-ray in patients with acute knee injury

### Ottawa Knee Rules
A knee radiographic examination is only required for patients with acute knee injuries with 1 or more of these findings related to age, tenderness, or function:
1. Age 55 years or older
2. Tenderness at head of fibula
3. Isolated tenderness of patella
4. Inability to flex to 90 degrees
5. Inability to bear weight both immediately and in the ED (4 steps)

### The Wagner Grading System of Foot Ulcers

Grade | Description | Management
|---|---|---
1. | Diabetic ulcer (superficial) | Outpatient; should include extensive debridement, local wound care, and relief of pressure. If there is significant erythema and or purulent exudate, then treatment for infection is warranted.
2. | Ulcer extension (involving ligament, tendon, joint capsule or fascia) | Same as 1
3. | Deep ulcer with abscess or osteomyelitis | Brief hospitalization to evaluate for possible osteomyelitis as well as peripheral arterial disease. Both of these conditions may need to be addressed prior to resolution of the ulcer. 
4. |Gangrene forefoot (partial)| Emergent hospitalization and surgical consultation, often resulting in amputation.
5. |Extensive gangrene of foot | Same as 4

Screening Tests
---------------

### Qualities of a Good Screening Test

1. Important health problem and with high prevalence in the population
2. The natural history of the disease should be adequately understood.
3. There should be a latent stage of the disease.
4. There should be a test or examination for the condition.
5. There should be an agreed policy on who to treat.
6. There should also be effective treatment for the condition.
7. Facilities for diagnosis and treatment should be available.
8. The test should be acceptable to the population and the total cost of finding a case should be economically balanced in relation to medical expenditure as a whole. The potential benefits of early detection and treatment of a condition need to be weighed against many factors including: adverse side effects of the screening test, time and effort required (of both the patient and the healthcare system) to take the test, financial cost of the test, potential psychological and physical harm of false positive results (such as labeling and over-treatment), adverse effects of the treatment.
9. Case-finding should be a continuous process, not just a \"once and for all\" project.
10. An effective screening test should have very good sensitivity (identify most or all potential cases) and specificity (label incorrectly as few as possible as potential cases). Even a test with a sensitivity of 95% will lead to many false positives when the prevalence of the condition is very low.

Radiology / Imaging Studies
---------------------------

### Key Concepts

-   More radioopaque object appears brighter than more radiolucent object on plain film
-   On plain film, 'lucency' is a focal area of bone or tissue that has decreased density e.g. on x-ray, a lucent bone lesion may appear like a dark, punched-out hole in the surrounding Nml bone. In contrast, sclerotic bone lesions appear denser than the surrounding bone and appear whiter.
-   On CT, tissue density is characterized by how light and dark it appears relative to the surrounding Nml parenchyma. Hypodense lesions (e.g. all air or fluid filled lesions, such as cysts and abcesses) appear darker than Nml tissue, whereas hyperdense lesions are brighter.
-   Ring enhancement refers to a bright intensity that can be observed surrounding many lesions on both CT and MRI when *contrast is administered*. It usually indicates local edema around a mass lesion, and in the brain can indicate the breakdown of blood-brain barrier.

### Radiologic Studies and Indications

#### Ultrasound

-   Abdominal aneurysm, gallbladder disease, renal and adrenal masses, kidney stones, ectopic pregnancy, pregnancy
-   80/20 rule: on Utz, gallstones are diagnosed 80% of the time and kidney stones 20% of the time; on x-ray gallstones are diagnosed 20% of the time and kidney stones 80% of the time.

#### 2D echocardiogram

Provide information on
-   Ejection fraction
-   Diastolic function
-   Pulmonary artery pressure

#### X-ray studies

A-F Approach to Chest x-ray
1.  Airway, Alignment
6.  Fields of lung: opacities, nodules, vascularity, bronchial cuffling etc.
3.  Cardiac Silhouette: less than 1/2 of the width?
2.  Bones: fractures, lytic/sclerotic lesions, defects
4.  Diaphram: flattened (COPD), blunted angles (effusions), or elevated (airspace consolidation)?
5.  External soft tissues: lymph nodes? subQ emphysema? other lesions

Special types

#### CT and MRI studies

-   CT is faster and less expensive, greater sensitivity for acute head trauma, better for detection of cord compression and calcifications

-   MRI is better for visualization of soft tissue and tissue edema, including brain and spinal cord (higher sensitivity for strokes, mass lesions, etc.). Allows for multiplanar imaging (Axial, coronal, sagittal, and oblique), no ionizing radiation.

#### Special studies
Study | Indication
|---|---
Endroscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) |  pancreatitis secondary to choledocolithiasis, cholestatic jaundice
Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) | Genito-urinary obstruction
PT/CT fused | FDG PET /CT commonly obtained for staging CA
Radionuclide bone scan | Identify foci of osteomyelitis or bone metastasis

Death
-----

Death is the permanent cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism.

Around 150,000 people die each day. People can die due to:

1.  Aging (largest unifying cause of death in developed world)
2.  Disease
    -   leading cause in developing countries: infectious diseases
    -   leading causes in developed countries: Atherosclerosis (MI and stroke), Cancer, as well as obesity and aging related diseases
3.  Suicide
4.  Homicide
5.  Predation
6.  Malnutrition
7.  Starvation
8.  Dehydration
9.  Accidents or trauma

It is important to recognize that dying is a process leading to death. In a hospital setting, one may see a dying patient rather than a dead patient.

8 Stages of death include:

Stages | Description
|----|---
**Pallor mortis** | paleness happens in 15 - 120 minutes after death
**Algor mortis** | reduction in body temperature following death
**Rigor mortis** | limbs of corpse become stiff and difficult to move or manipulate
**Livor mortis** | a settling of blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body
**Putrefaction** | beginning signs of decomposition
**Decomposition** | reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant order
**Skeletonization** | the end of decomposition, where all soft tissues have decomposed, leaving only the skeleton
**Fossilization** | the natural preservation of the skeletal remains formed over a very long period.

### Definitions of Death 

Definitions of death is controversial. There are three main ones at the moment:

-   Circulatory Definition of Death (DCDD): circulatory and respiratory functions cease
    -   Problem: cessation of these functions are not always irreversible, therefore careful definitions of permanent and irreversible are required
    -   Problem: without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of life support devices, organ transplants and artificial pacemakers.

-   Brain death / Biological death: irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain (some argues for only neo-cortex)
    -   It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of consciousness; this is a reliable and reproducible criteria and the brain is crucial in determining our identity or who we are as human beings.
    -   Problem:    
        -   mechanically ventilated patients who are brain dead can retain a large array of biological functions such as the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete waste, heal wounds, fight infections, and to gestate fetuses (if pregnant).
        -   EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain drugs, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, or hypothermia can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis.
        -   In cases of electric shock, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned nerves to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. People found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an emergency room. This \"diving response\", in which metabolic activity and oxygen requirements are minimal, is something humans share with cetaceans called the mammalian diving reflex.

-   Information-theoretic death: The structures that encode memory and personality have been so disrupted that it is no longer possible in principle to recover them.
    -   Currently only used in cryonics

In 1995, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), established a set of three criteria that became the medical standard for diagnosing neurologic death:
-   coma with clear etiology
-   cessation of breathing
-   and lack of brainstem reflexes

### Mechanism of Death 

Loss of homeostasis, leads to cardiac arrest, causing loss of oxygen and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the brain and other tissues.

### Diagnosis of Death 

Steps when you have been asked to confirm the death of a patient:

1.  Go through Medical History

    -   Identification of history or physical examination findings that provide a clear etiology of brain dysfunction
    -   Exclusion of any condition that might confound the subsequent examination of cortical or brain stem function

2.  Perform Physical Examination You should observe the patient for a minimum of 5 minutes. To ensure that you perform all necessary steps, you can use a systematic **A to E approach**:

    -   Airway / Breathing -- Auscultate the lungs for \>1min
        -   There will be no respiratory effort and no audible breath sounds.

    -   Circulation -- Palpate for a pulse for \>1min and auscultate the heart for \>1min

        -   There will be no palpable central pulse and no audible heart sounds\*
        -   Make sure you check for any palpable cardiac pacemaker
        -   EEG is shows asystole

    -   Disability -- Check for a pupillary response and check for a motor response to pain

        -   Following 5 minutes of continued cardio-respiratory arrest the patient's pupils will be fixed, dilated and unresponsive to light.
        -   There will be no response to a painful stimulus. This can be tested by applying supra-orbital pressure and looking for any motor response.
  
    -   Exposure -- The patient may be peripherally cold (depending on the timing of your assessment)

3.  Notify next of kin

4.  Certification and brain death documentation

    DATE 02/12, TIME: 2310: DEATH CERTIFICATION
    
    No audible breath or heart sounds for greater than 1 minute.

    No palpable pulse for greater than 1 minute. No palpable cardiac pacemaker.

    Pupils are fixed, dilated and unreactive to light.

    There is no response to painful stimulus.

    The patient has died.

### DNR, AMD, and LPA in Singapore

-   DNR is only an instruction, it can be part of Advanced Medical Directive (AMD), Advanced Care Planning (ACP), as well an order from LPA or the treating physician
-   AMD and LPA has legal power but not ACP; Yet the latter is easier to use than AMD. AMD has very limited applicability
-   To make an AMD, one need to get a witness and a physician to certify the plan, and submit it to a registry
-   Doctors are not allowed to ask patients about their AMD status.

### Diseases and Death 

Disease | Consequence
|---|---
Smokers | lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, COPD
Hypertension | single largest risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, uncontrolled hypertension decreases life expectancy by 20 years, incurs risk for coronary artery disease, hypertensive cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular disease and chronic renal disease
Diabetes | cardiovascular disease and chronic renal failure; hx of DM induces the same level of risk in CVD patients as a previous MI
DVT | More than 95% of pulmonary emboli arise from thrombi in the deep venous system of the lower extremities. Ninety percent of deaths due to pulmonary embolism result within an hour or two -- before diagnostic and therapeutic plans can be implemented.

Aging 
-----

Questions:

-   Is aging the same as senescence?

Senescence or biological aging is the gradual deterioration of functional characteristics. The word senescence can refer either to cellular senescence or to senescence of the whole organism.

Senescence is the inevitable fate of all multicellular organisms with germ-soma separation, but it can be delayed or accelerated:

-   calorie restriction can extend lifespan by 50% in rats

-   some organisms such as Hydra have negligible senescence

-   rare human mutation can cause accelerated aging (i.e. Progeroid syndromes)

-   exposure to ultraviolet radiation accelerates skin aging

Biological aging and chronological aging are also different concepts because organisms from the same species can age at different speeds.

**Gompertz--Makeham law of mortality** says that that the age-dependent component of the mortality rate increases exponentially with age.

In 2013, Lopez-Otin et al defined nine hallmarks of aging that are common between organisms with emphasis on mammals:

1.  genomic instability,
2.  telomere attrition,
3.  epigenetic alterations,
4.  loss of proteostasis,
5.  deregulated nutrient sensing,
6.  mitochondrial dysfunction,
7.  cellular senescence,
8.  stem cell exhaustion,
9.  altered intercellular communication.

Aging has been defined as *\"a progressive deterioration of physiological function, an intrinsic age-related process of loss of viability and increase in vulnerability.\"* It is characterized by

-   the declining ability to respond to stress
-   increased homeostatic imbalance
-   increased risk of aging-associated diseases including cancer and heart disease
