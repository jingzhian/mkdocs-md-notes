General ID Knowledge
-------------------

Word | Definition
|------|--------
Fomite | A fomite or fomes is any inanimate object that, when contaminated with or exposed to infectious agents, can transfer disease to a new host.

Systemic Infectious Diseases
----------------------------

### Tuberculosis

Regional Infectious Diseases
----------------------------

### Lymes Diease

Caused by Borrelia burgdorferi.

Typically presents with acute monoarticular joint pain.

More likely to occur during the summer in endemic areas, such as the northeastern region of the United States.

Usually a history of possible exposure to a tick bite.

Typically a history of a rash, this does not rule out the possibility of Lyme disease, as some patients with Lyme disease do not develop or notice a rash.


Infectious Disease Syndromes
----------------------------

### Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome

Complication of meningococcemia involving adrenal gland destruction, disseminated intravascular coagulation and shock.

Meningococcal LOS differ from enteric LPS because it lacks repeating O-antigen of LPS; the outer membrane LOS (lipooligosaccharide) &rarr; Toll like receptor 4 &rarr; TNF-&alpha;, IL-6 and IL-8

Sexually Transmitted Diseases
-----------------------------
### General Information

#### Cervical Discharge Microscopy

Microorganism | Feature
|---|---
N Gonorrhoeae | Diplocci on endocervical smear, low sensitivity (especially in asymptomatic patients)
Bacterial Vaginosis | Clue cells
Spirochete | Dark-field microscopy
Tichomonads | Flagellated protozoans


### STI Frameworks

#### GENITAL DISCHARGE IN A MALE
1. Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU)
2. Gonorrhoea

#### GENITAL DISCHARGE IN A FEMALE
1. Physiological
2. Candidal vulvo-vaginitis
3. Chlamydia cervicitis
4. Gonococcal cervicitis
5. Trichomoniasis Bacterial vaginosis
Herpetic cervicitis
6. Mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC)

### Trichomonas

**Presentation**
- Vaginal discharge with odor or itching
- OR Asymptomatic (picked up during screening in high risk patients)

Diagnosis is made by saline wet mount; rapid antigen testing, or Trichomonas culture. 

Management
- Surveillance
  - HIV screening is recommended for patients in all health-care settings after the patient is notified that testing will be performed unless the patient declines (opt-out screening). Separate written consent for HIV testing should not be required; general consent for medical care should be considered sufficient to encompass consent for HIV testing.


### Chlamydia

**Presentation**

Dysuria, discharge (penile or vaginal), pain with sex, abdominal or testicular pain, breakthrough bleeding or can be asymptomatic. 

**Diagnosis** 

Nucleic acid amplification test of urine, endocervical sample, or urethral sample. 

### Gonorrhea

The causative organism is Neisseria gonorrhoea – the gonococcus. The preferred sites of infection are the columnar and transitional epithelia. The common sites of infection include the urethra, the endocervix, the rectum, the pharynx and the conjunctiva. Classically gonorrhoea affects the male urethra and the endocervical canal and urethra in women.
Man is the only reservoir and sexual contact is the commonest and the most important mode of transmission. However, during birth the conjunctiva of the newborn may be infected by contamination with the infected genital secretions of the mother during passage through the birth canal.
Non-sexual modes of transmission are uncommon. Gonococcal vulvo-vaginitis in children occurs from contaminated towels, bed sheets or more likely direct genital contact from infected adults.
Adult gonococcal conjunctivitis is usually acquired from fingers contaminated with gonococcal genital secretions.
Incubation period is 3 to 5 days (up to 2 weeks).


**Presentation**
Patients with gonorrhea can be either asymptomatic, or have dysuria, discharge (penile or vaginal), pain with sex, abdominal or testicular pain, or breakthrough bleeding. 

**Clinical Features**
- Male presents with urethritis
  - dysuria, no frequency
  - purulent urethral discharge
  - asymptomatic in 10%
  - no constitutional symptoms usually
  - meatitis
  - enlarged inguinal lymph nodes
- Female 
  - Cervicitis: no symptoms in 60% patients, vaginal discharge in the rest
  - Urethritis: dysuria
  - Endometritis: irregular bleeding, lower abdominal discomfort, mucopurulent discharge
- Both Sexes
  - Oropharyngeal: asymptomatic usually
  - Rectal:  may present as tenesmus and purulent discharge - examination may show proctitis

**Complications**
1. Acute epididymitis. Epididymo-orchitis
2. Prostatitis
3. Tysonitis
4. Urethral stricture – late complications
5. Acute salpingitis. Pelvic inflammatory disease. Tubo-ovarian mass
6. Chronic salpingitis. Tubal infertility. Ectopic pregnancy
7. Peri-hepatitis (Fitz Hugh Curtis Syndrome)
8. Bartholinitis, Bartholin’s abscess
9. Conjunctivitis in adults
10. Opthalmia neonatorum
11. Vulvo-vaginitis in children
12. Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI)

**Diagnosis**
- Nucleic acid amplification test of urine, endocervical sample, or urethral sample; 
- Gonococcal culture for rectal or pharyngeal specimens. 

#### Disseminated Gonococcus
Majority (80-90%) of patients are women usually in 16 to 35 year old age group. Onset of bacteraemia often occurs during the first week of the menstrual cycle, second half of pregnancy and just after delivery.

**Clinical Features**
Vesiculopustular rash, tenosynovitis, and migratory polyarthralgias. Most patients are febrile, and the skin lesions are predominantly found on the distal extremities and usually last only a few days. 
- Arthritis: Multiple asymmetrical peripheral arthritis. Most common joints involved include the knees, ankles, wrists, small joints of hands and feet. Tenosynovitis may be prominent.
- Skin Lesions: Petechial, haemorrhagic papules or pustules occur in crops numbering from 5 to 20. Characteristically distributed peripherally on arms and legs.
- Fever: Low grade. Intermittent.
- Other Organs: Endocarditis, pericarditis, meningitis.

#### GONOCOCCAL OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM
Acute conjunctivitis occurring within the first 3 weeks of life from contact with infected birth canal during childbirth. The mother is usually asymptomatic.

**Clinical Features**
- Redness and swelling of eyelids associated with purulent discharge. 
- Corneal perforation, ulceration and blindness may occur if not treated promptly.
- Incubation period between 1 to 5 days.

**Differentials**
- chlamydial ophthalmia (mother has chlamydial genital infection)
- pyogenic (staph aureus) infection
- chemical conjunctivitis

### Syphilis

#### Secondary Syphilis
Secondary syphilis is characterized by a rash that appears from 2 to 8 weeks after the chancre develops and sometimes before it heals, a flulike syndrome, and generalized adenopathy.

Condyloma lata are a manifestation of secondary syphilis characterized by flattened pink or gray velvety papules.  These are seen most commonly at the mucous membranes and moist skin of the genital organs, perineum, and mouth.

### HIV 
Persons at high risk for HIV infection should be screened for HIV at least annually.
