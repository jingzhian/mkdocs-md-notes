===================

Infection Control {#ssec:id-ic}
-----------------

Hospital acquired infection: infection not present before coming to the hospital but developed while in the hospital.

### Modes of Transmission {#ssec:id-ic-mot}

Microorganisms are spread primarily through three ways within a hospital setting

1.  Airborne: occurs when infectious pathogens are aerosolized and remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. e.g. TB, chickenpox, measles,

2.  Droplet: occurs when droplets containing microorganisms from the infected person are propelled a short distance through the air and deposited on the susceptible host's conjunctivae, nasal mucosa, or mouth. E.g. repiratory tract infections, mumps, rubella, MRSA respiratory disperser, Neisseria Meningitis

3.  Contact: there are two forms of contact transmission

    -   Direct transmission: involves physical contract between an infected person and a susceptible person

    -   Indirect transmission: involves contact of a susceptible person with a contaminated intermediate object

### Identifying Patient's Precaution Status {#ssec:id-ic-ps}

Method of identifying infectious patients in SGH

-   Coloured discs: [multi-drug resistant organism]{style="color: orange"} and [clostridium difficile]{style="color: green"} patients are identified by orange / green discs on their medical records.

-   Precaution status can also be seen on Sunrise Clinical Manager (SCM), outpatient appointment system (OAS), and systems, applications and products (SAP) electronic systems.

### Eliminate Transmission {#ssec:id-ic-et}

Standard Precaution

-   What does it do

    -   Reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from both recognised and unrecognized sources of infection in hospital

    -   Apply to ALL patients receiving care in hospitals regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infection status.

-   When is it used?\
    These are applied when one has contact with blood, non-intact skin, body fluids, mucous membrane

-   How

    -   Hand hygiene: Moments of hand hygiene (WHO)

        -   Inpatient

            1.  Before touching a patient

            2.  Before clean / aseptic procedure

            3.  After body fluid exposure risk

            4.  After touching a patient

            5.  After touching patient surroundings

        -   Outpatient

            1.  Before touching a patient

            2.  Before clean / aseptic procedure

            3.  After body fluid exposure risk

            4.  After touching a patient

Transmission-based Precautions

Regional Infectious Diseases
----------------------------

### Lymes Diease

Caused by Borrelia burgdorferi.

Typically presents with acute monoarticular joint pain.

More likely to occur during the summer in endemic areas, such as the northeastern region of the United States.

Usually a history of possible exposure to a tick bite.

Typically a history of a rash, this does not rule out the possibility of Lyme disease, as some patients with Lyme disease do not develop or notice a rash.

Systemic Infectious Diseases
----------------------------

### Tuberculosis

Sexually Transmitted Diseases
-----------------------------

Patients with chlamydia present with dysuria, discharge (penile or vaginal), pain with sex, abdominal or testicular pain, breakthrough bleeding or can be asymptomatic. Diagnosis is made by nucleic acid amplification test of urine, endocervical sample, or urethral sample. Patients with gonorrhea can be either asymptomatic, or have dysuria, discharge (penile or vaginal), pain with sex, abdominal or testicular pain, or breakthrough bleeding. Diagnosis is made by nucleic acid amplification test of urine, endocervical sample, or urethral sample; gonococcal culture for rectal or pharyngeal specimens. Presenting symptoms of trichomonas include vaginal discharge with odor or itching, so testing for T. vaginalis should be performed in women seeking care for vaginal discharge. But trichomonas can also be asymptomatic and screening for T. vaginalis can be considered in those at high risk for infection, such as women who have new or multiple partners (the situation presented in this question), have a history of STIs, exchange sex for payment, and use injection drugs. Diagnosis is made by saline wet mount; rapid antigen testing, or Trichomonas culture. HIV screening is recommended for patients in all health-care settings after the patient is notified that testing will be performed unless the patient declines (opt-out screening). Persons at high risk for HIV infection should be screened for HIV at least annually. Separate written consent for HIV testing should not be required; general consent for medical care should be considered sufficient to encompass consent for HIV testing.

Infectious Disease Syndromes
----------------------------

### Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome

Complication of meningococcemia involving adrenal gland destruction, disseminated intravascular coagulation and shock.

Meningococcal LOS differ from enteric LPS because it lacks repeating O-antigen of LPS; the outer membrane LOS (lipooligosaccharide) -\> Toll like receptor 4 -\> TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6 and IL-8

Sexually Transmitted Diseases
-----------------------------

### Cervical Discharge Microscopy

-   N Gonorrhoeae: diplocci on endocervical smear, low sensivity (esp asymptomatic patients)

-   Bacterial Vaginosis: clue cells

-   Spirochetes: Dark-field microscopy

-   Tichomonads: Flagellated protozoans
