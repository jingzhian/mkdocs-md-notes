<li>Type I rashes, due to IgE dependent mast cell and basophil degranulation, tend to occur very quickly. These are examined using the skin prick.</li>
<li>Type II rashes, due to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, are more likely to manifest as blisters or bullae (e.g. pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid) than papules. </li>
<li>Type III rashes, due to IgG mediated immune-complex deposition, resulting in phagocyte and NK cell activation, as well as complement fixation, tend to be more erythematous and maculopapular.</li>

<p>The skin is composed of the following layers, each serving its own function.
1. Stratum corneum: composed of compact keratin
2. Epidermis which is composed of 
   - Keratinocytes
   - Melanocytes which produce melanin, important in skin pigmentation
   - Langerhan's cells which are antigen presenting cells
3. Dermal-epidermal junction: composed of protein/collagenous substances separating the epidermis from the dermis.
4. The dermis is composed of collagen/elastic tissues, neurovascular bundles and the adnexal structures, which include hair follicles, hair, sweat glands, sebaceous glands and nails. It can be further divided into two parts:
   - Papillary dermis 
   - Reticular dermis (i.e. Hypodermis?)
5. Subcutaneous fat

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A detailed history-taking is usually unnecessary in the initial stages of assessment. The approach to a dermatological problem should consist of the following:
1. Obtaining a short <strong>initial history</strong> to establish the duration, primary location and secondary spread of the skin lesions, associated symptoms and past dermatological disorders.
2. Then proceed to a <strong>full physical examination</strong> of the skin, hair, nails and mucus membranes. Examination of the skin should include the affected skin and all other areas of the skin. Dermatology requires acumen in recognition of physical signs and their significance. Identifying the essential features helps one arrive at a correct diagnosis.
3. <strong>Additional history</strong> is then obtained after the examination. The history taking should be directed based on the provisional diagnosis and differential diagnoses suspected. For example, when a contact dermatitis, occupational dermatosis, a drug eruption or a sexually transmitted disease is suspected, relevant history related to contactants, work processes, drug ingestions and exposure to STI respectively should be elicited.
4. A <strong>clinical diagnosis and differential diagnoses</strong> is achieved.
5. A full systemic physical examination is usually not necessary. Most skin conditions are confined to the skin. However, when connective tissue disease, systemic involvement or cutaneous manifestation of underlying systemic disease is suspected, a <strong>full systemic examination</strong> should be undertaken.
6. <strong>Laboratory</strong> investigations including skin biopsies may be necessary to confirm or exclude the diagnosis and detect systemic complications.</p>
<h4 id="history-taking">History Taking<a class="headerlink" href="#history-taking" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>It is important to elicit the following information during history taking.
1. Duration of symptoms and signs.
2. Primary site of rash and subsequent spread.
3. Morphology of lesion at primary site and subsequent evolution.
4. Course of disease (progressive / static / improving / persistent / fluctuating / episodic).
5. Associated symptoms - itch, pain, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia. 
6. Aggravating factor
7. Relieving factors
8. Recent contact with someone with a similar rash.
10. Previous episodes of similar skin disease.
12. Personal history of atopy
    - Hand washing in COVID19 trigger pan-eczema
11. Present and past medical history including treatment received.
9. Topical and systemic medication used before and after onset of rash, as well as its effect on present illness.
13.  Family history of skin disorders (atopy and medical problems)
2.  Occupational history including part-time job.
3.  Social history including hobbies.
4.  Domestic work, pets.
5.  Cleansing habits</p>
<h4 id="physical-examination">Physical Examination<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-examination" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p><strong>Basic Considerations during examination</strong>
1. Always conduct the examination under bright natural light or a well lit room.
2. The skin should be adequately exposed but patient's dignity and privacy must be maintained at all times during examination.
3. Observe the skin lesions. Look for specific signs. Palpate the lesions
4. Examine the mucous membrane, scalp, hair and nails for associated signs.
5. Use a torch, spatula and magnifying lens where necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution of the Rash</strong>
The distribution of the skin lesions is important in diagnosing skin diseases. Many conditions have typical patterns or affect specific regions of the body.
- Extensor surface: psoriasis
- Flexor surface: atopic eczema
- Palms and soles: erythema multiforme, secondary syphilis and eczema.</p>
<p><strong>The Arrangement of Lesions</strong>
The arrangement of the skin lesions may give a clue to the diagnosis, e.g.:
- Examples of linear lesion
  - Contact with exogenous agents e.g. a contact reaction to an exogenous substance brushing across the skin.
  - Koebner phenomenon
  - Developmental origin: epidermal naevi, incontinentia pigmenti
  - Blood vessels, nerves or lymphatics: herpes zoster, thrmoboplebitis
  - Unknown origin e.g lichen striatus,morphea,m porokeratosis
- Group lesions: typically exogenous, related to nerve or vessels e.g. Herpes simplex virus infection, bites, warts
  - Zosterform: refers to lesions arranged along the cutaneous distribution of a spinal nerve.
- Annular or arciform  (semi circular) lesions, centrifugal spread, refractory centre e.g. dermatophytosis, Erythema Multiforme</p>
<p><strong>Colour of Lesions</strong> The colour of the skin lesion may be diagnostic in some skin disorders
- purplish blue e.g. lichen planus
- heliotropes in dermatomyositis
- leucoderma e.g. vitiligo</p>
<p><strong>Size</strong>
It is important to measure some lesions, especially nevi and skin malignancies like squamous cell carcinoma. 
- Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin greater than 2 cm in diameter is regarded to be high risk for recurrence and metastasis. 
- Nevi larger than 6 mm in diameter are more likely to be malignant than smaller nevi.</p>
<p><strong>Shape of Lesions</strong> Descriptions like oval, round, linear etc. can be used to describe the shape of the lesions. </p>
<p><strong>Palpation</strong>
Additional tests: texture, consistency, thickness, tenderness, temperature
Scratching: nature of saling; elicit dermographism
Linear pressure - Nikoplsky's sign in pemphigus or TEN
Rubbing - Darier's sign (blistering in erticaria poigmentosa)
- Dermatographism: The whealing or urticarial response of the skin produced when it is stroked firmly with a pointed object is known as dermatographism ("skin writing"). This phenomenon may be elicited in up to 50% of normal people with firm stroking and is an exaggeration of the physiologic triple response of Lewis. The diagnosis of dermatographism is given only to those few individuals who manifest an urticarial response to mild physical trauma. </p>
<p>The significance of dermatographism is primarily its ability to reproduce the lesions of which the patient complains. It is classified as a form of physical urticaria and is not actually more common in people with chronic urticaria than in other people. Interestingly, it has been reported that up to 75% of pregnant women may have dermatographism, and the wheal response may also be elicited with urticaria pigmentosa (see Darier's sign, below).
- Darler's Sign:  Similar to dermatographism, this sign refers to the wheal or hive produced by rubbing a flat, tan macule of urticaria pigmentosa. Lesions of urticaria pigmentosa contain excessive numbers of mast cells, which release histamine in response to trauma and cause the skin to urticate. Lesions of urticaria pigmentosa in children may even blister when traumatized, and a solitary mastocytoma may also give this response. Although Darier's sign is virtually diagnostic of urticaria pigmentosa, failure to elicit this sign does not necessarily exclude the diagnosis.
- Nikolsky's Sign: This sign is elicited in blistering diseases to determine whether the epidermis is adherent to the underlying dermis. A finger or rounded object such as a pencil eraser is used to rub or rotate the skin with a mild shearing effect. One should suspect disadherence in the presence of large blisters, large areas of erosion and crusting, and areas of nonblanchable red skin. Diagnostic possibilities include pemphigus and toxic epidermal necrolysis due to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Nikolsky's sign is most easily produced when the epidermis is acantholytic, a condition in which the epidermal cells lose attachment to one another. This sign is not diagnostic or absolutely specific, for it may be seen in severe cases of erythema multiformae, epidermolysis bullosa, pemphigoid, and variegate porphyria.
- Auspitz Sign: When the thick white scale of psoriasis is carefully scraped away from the surface of a plaque, tiny bleeding points may be seen in the underlying epidermis. These points are the vascular dermal papillae that have been traumatized by removal of the thin suprapapillary epidermis. It is typical, but not diagnostic, of psoriasis.</p>
<p><strong>Office Techniques for Dermatological Testing</strong>
- Diascopy: Diascopy is a test for blanchability performed by applying pressure with a finger or glass slide and observing color changes. It is used to determine whether a lesion is vascular (inflammatory or congenital), nonvascular (nevus), or hemorrhagic (petechia or purpura)</p>
<p>This technique is a more sophisticated modification of the simplest method for assessing superficial erythema: pressing the fingertip against the skin and withdrawing it quickly to see if blanching occurs. Diascopy is a refinement in which a piece of clear glass or plastic is pressed against the skin while the observer looks directly at the lesion under pressure. The purpose of this procedure is to empty blood from the superficial vessels to determine if skin redness is due to blood within vessels (erythema) or extravasated into the skin (petechiae, purpura). The former will blanch with pressure, the latter will not. By varying the pressure on the skin, vessels can be seen to blanch and fill. The amount of pressure required to blanch a given lesion is variable, but care should be exercised when using a glass microscope slide, lest a sharp edge damage the skin or the slide break under pressure and lacerate the skin. It is probably best to use two glass slides together to minimize this risk.
  - Hemorrhagic lesions and nonvascular lesions do not blanch("negative diascopy");
  - inflammatory lesions do("positive diascopy").
  - granulomatous nodules such as sarcoidosis, granuloma annulare, and lupus vulgaris (all three of which will reveal a brownish-yellow "apple jelly" translucent quality upon diascopy).
  -  telangiectasia (in which the central "feeder" vessel may be distinguished); 
- Dermoscopy: aka epiluminescence microscopy, it allows for inspection of skin lesions unobstructed by skin surface reflections</p>
<p><strong>Laboratory Investigations</strong>
- Skin scraping
- Patch testing
- Photopatch testing
- Phototesting</p>
<p><strong>Associated symptoms</strong>
Associated symptoms, like itching, pain, or burning sensation are helpful to make a diagnosis of certain skin diseases. Eczema tends to be itchy compared to fungal skin infections. Pain is usually associated with herpes simplex or herpes zosters.</p>

<p>Definitions
-   Primary Skin Lesions: uncomplicated lesions that represent initial pathologic change, uninfluenced by secondary alterations such as infection, trauma, and surgery
-   Secondary Skin Lesions: changes that occur as consequences of progression of the disease, scratching, or infection of primary lesions.</p>
<p><strong>Size</strong>
- miliary (1-2 mm)
- small (2-5 mm) 
- large (&gt;5mm)</p>
<p><strong>Shape</strong>
- round
- conical 
- flattened 
- umbilicated 
- elongated 
- angular 
- polygonal 
- stellate 
- annular: circular with normal skin in the center.
  - Common conditions: drug eruptions, secondary syphilis and lupus erythematosus
  - iris lesion (target or bull's eye lesion): special type of annular lesion in which an erythematous annular macule or papule develops a second ring or a purplish papule or vesicle in the center (e.g. seen in Lyme disease)
- hemispherical</p>

<p>Symptoms in dermatology are usually characteristic. Common symptoms include:
- <strong>Itch</strong>: Note
   Some skin diseases, e.g. scabies, lichen planus, contact eczema and atopic eczema are invariably itchy. In some skin diseases, the severity of pruritus is variable and very subjective e.g. psoriasis and pityriasis rosea.
   - Pruritus without rash.
   - Pruritus with excoriation, Prurigo.
   - Pruritus with rash.
   - Pruritus may precede or follow the rash.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pain</strong>: The commonest painful dermatological lesions are associated with skin infections (e.g. herpes zoster); skin fissures; skin erosions and ulcers especially of the mucus membrane; cutaneous vasculitis (especially those associated with skin infarcts).</li>
<li><strong>Paresthesia and Anaesthesia</strong>: Paresthesia is often associated with inflammation affecting the nerves, e.g. herpes simplex infection and herpes zoster. Tuberculoid Hansen's disease is associated with anaesthesia.</li>
<li><strong>Tightness</strong>: This symptom is often seen in patients with chronic inflammatory skin diseases, e.g. over dry psoriatic plaques and chronic eczema. It is severe in patients with scleroderma/morphoea.</li>

Erythema marginatum |  a faintly erythematous, ring-like rash that comes and goes, is a manifestation of acute rheumatic fever
Exfoliative Dermatitis or Erythroderma | Intense and usually widespread reddening of the skin due to inflammatory skin disease (erythema and scaling in &gt;90% of the body). Bright red patches coalesce and gradually peel. It often precedes or is associated with exfoliation (skin peeling off in scales or layers), when it may also be known as exfoliative dermatitis (ED). It may be drug in-induced, idiopathic, or secondary to an underlying dermatological or systemic disease. <img alt="erythroderma" src="../figures/skin-erythroderma.jpeg" />
Koebner phenomenon | aka isomorphic phenomenon or isomorphic reaction, it is the phenomenon where small trauma, such as rubbing of the skin, results in the development of a skin leision; it is seen most often in psoriasis, eczema, lichen planus and vitiligo</p>

<td>Incisional / punch biopsy</td>
<td>Incisional biopsy means taking out only a representative portion of a lesion. It is typically used for large lesions for which excision is impractical or for lesions with a low risk of malignancy. Punch biopsy is a specific incisional biopsy using a cylindrical dermal biopsy tool.</td>
<td>Disposable punches are very convenient and available from two to eight millimeters in size.A full thickness of skin can easily be obtained with a punch biopsy. If a lesion is less than three millimeters in size, it does not need stitches after biopsy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Excisional biopsy</td>
<td>Excisional biopsy involves removing the whole lesion with a two to three millimeter margin, depending on the nature of the lesion.</td>
<td>Larger-sized punches may be useful for excisional punch biopsies. This is the diagnostic method of choice if there is a strong suspicion of malignant melanoma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shave biopsy</td>
<td>Shave biopsy is feasible when the lesion is elevated above the surface. It is used for microscopy for mycology, bacteria, parasites, viral inclusions body and giant cells. It is also used for culture for fungus, bacteria, parasite, and viruses</td>
<td>Some experts occasionally elevate the lesion with lidocaine and shave in certain circumstances in order to avoid stitches.</td>

<p>The risk with this procedure is that obviously you will have a scar after the procedure. There is also a small chance of bleeding and infection, even though we do our best to prevent these things. After the procedure, Steri-Strip may fall off after a few days. If patient sees that the wound is red about six to seven days after the procedure, or sees pus coming out, (signs of delayed healing or infection) he should contact Dr without delay.

<h4 id="sun-protection">Sun Protection<a class="headerlink" href="#sun-protection" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Sunburn is an inflammatory response to excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.  Regardless of skin type, additional risks from UV exposure include photoaging and skin cancer.  Therefore, all patients should be counseled about the carcinogenic effects of UV exposure and the benefits of photoprotection.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sun avoidance is the best method of photoprotection, especially during peak hours of UV intensity, from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM.  </li>
<li>If it is impractical to stay indoors, broad-spectrum sunscreens with sun protection factor (SPF) ≥30 should be used. <ul>
<li>Sunscreen should be applied liberally 15-30 minutes before sun exposure, as this patient does, to allow the formation of a protective film on the skin, and reapplied at least every 2 hours.  </li>
<li>Sunscreens with SPF &gt;50 provide a negligible increase in UV protection as compared to sunscreens with SPF 30-50 and are not routinely recommended. </li>
<li>Even if products are labeled as "water-resistant," reapplication after swimming is necessary as sunscreen is washed off with swimming and sweating .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sunscreen alone is inadequate. <ul>
<li>Dark colors, long sleeves, and broad-brim hats are recommended to block sun exposure.  Darker fabrics offer greater UV protection as the rays cannot penetrate the fabric as well.</li>
<li>In addition, cloud coverage does not block UV rays, which can be reflected off water, sand, snow, and concrete.  As a result, patients can burn in the shade or while skiing in the winter.</li>

<td>Mohs microscopic surgery</td>
<td>Patients with any nonmelanoma skin cancer &gt;2cm, lesions with indistinct margins, recurrent lesions, and those close to important structures, including the eyes, nose, and mouth, should be considered for referral for complete excision via Mohs micrographic surgery, with possible plastic repair.</td>
<td>The surgeon can immediately review the pathology to confirm complete excision during a staged excision. Since this allows removal of the least necessary amount of tissue, this procedure is indicated in cosmetically sensitive areas. This ability to immediately confirm pathology is also useful in lesions with indistinct margins where more tissue than clinically apparent may require removal. If a difficult repair is anticipated or a poor cosmetic result is expected, referral is appropriate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Surgical excision</td>
<td>Most widely used treatment for cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas (SCCs), particularly high risk lesions.</td>
<td>Well defined, small (&lt; 2 centimeters) SCC lacking any high-risk features requires a four millimeter margin of normal tissue around the visible tumor to result in 95% histologic cure rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cryotherapy</td>
<td>Useful for small, well defined, low risk invasive SCCs and Bowen's disease.</td>
<td>Destroys malignant cells by freezing and thawing. Cryotherapy does not permit histologic confirmation of the adequacy of treatment margins; thus, a substantial amount of training and experience is required to achieve consistently high cure rates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Radiation therapy</td>
<td>An option for the initial management of small, well-defined, primary SCCs, especially older patients and those who are not surgical candidates.</td>
<td>However radiation therapy is contraindicated on tumors located on trunk and extremities. These areas are subjected to greater trauma and tension than skin on the head and neck, and they are more prone to break down and ulcerate as a result of the atrophy and poor vascularity of irradiated tissue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)</td>
<td>Actinic keratoses</td>
<td>Although topical 5 -FU is not approved for the treatment of Bowen's disease (squamous-cell carcinoma in-situ) and superficial SCCs, it is widely used in these diseases when other treatment modalities are impractical and for patients who refuse surgical treatment.</td>

<h3 id="generalized-rashes">Generalized Rashes<a class="headerlink" href="#generalized-rashes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>There are a few subtopics of generalized rashes
- Viral Exanthems
- Drug Eruptions
- Rashes Associated with Fever</p>
<p>One should also consider the nature of the rash
- Non-specific maculopapular rashes
- Purpura
- Petechiae
- Bullous or vesicular rashes</p>
<p>Different rashes may also affect specific patient populations
- Pregnant Women
- Newborn
- Immunocompromised persons
- Persons from certain geographical locations (e.g. topics and dengue)</p>
<p>Patients with acute generalized maculopapular rashes and no systemic symptoms are often treated symptomatically without a definitive diagnosis. If the rash does not resolve spontaneously, skin biopsy and blood testing (e.g., serologies, complete blood count) may be indicated. </p>
<p>Current recommendations for practice
- Systemic symptoms, and involvement of palms, soles, and nails can help distinguish various rashes. [C]
- When evaluating generalized rash, physicians should determine the patient's primary symptom, then focus on the clinical appearance of the rash before taking a more focused history to help narrow down the differential diagnosis. [C]</p>
<p>Keys to Diagnosis in History Taking
- <strong>Risk Assessment</strong>: recent travel, insect and plant exposure, drug exposure (including over-the-counter drugs, alternative medications, and illicit drugs), contact with persons who are ill, pets, hobbies, occupational exposures, chemical exposure, chronic illness, sexual history, personal or family history of atopy (e.g., asthma, allergic rhinitis, childhood eczema).
- <strong>Associated Symptoms</strong>: recent systemic symptoms, especially fever
- <strong>Lesion Specific</strong>: pruritus, painful lesions, the initial site of involvement</p>
<p>Keys to Physical Examination
- The <strong>size</strong> of individual lesions can vary from pinpoint to total-body redness
- The <strong>shape</strong> of individual lesions and their <strong>tendency to cluster (arrangement)</strong> can also provide important clues.
  - linear patterns of erythema or vesicles are typical of poison ivy; 
  - oval lesions are typical of pityriasis rosea; 
  - round lesions are typical of nummular eczema; 
  - annular lesions are typical of tinea corporis;
  - geometric patterns may imply a contact component
- The <strong>color</strong> of the lesions should also be noted. Although most generalized rashes are pink or red, lichen planus is characterized by violaceous lesions, and secondary syphilis by red-brown lesions </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Staphylococcus Scalded Skin Syndrome</strong> - caused by exfoliative toxin–producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and typically occurs in infants and young children.  A prodrome of fever, irritability, and skin tenderness is followed by generalized erythema, superficial flaccid blisters, and epidermal shedding with light pressure (ie, Nikolsky sign).</li>
<li><strong>Bullous impetigo</strong> is a localized form of SSSS also caused by exfoliative toxin–producing S aureus.  Patients typically appear well, with blisters confined to the primary area of infection.  In addition, when ruptured, the blisters leave a distinct honey-colored crust, which is not seen in this patient.</li>
<li><strong>Erysipelas</strong> is a bacterial infection (eg, group A Streptococcus) of the dermis that presents with a well-demarcated, warm, tender area of erythema.  Overlying bullae can develop in severe cases, and patients often have constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, chills).  However, diffuse rash and shedding do not occur.</li>
<li><strong>Toxic epidermal necrolysis</strong> manifests as extensive (&gt;30% body surface area) skin blistering and erosion; it is typically triggered by a medication.  Nikolsky sign is positive; however, mucous membrane involvement is expected with this condition but is not seen in this patient.</li>

<h3 id="urticaria">Urticaria<a class="headerlink" href="#urticaria" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong>History</strong>
1. Ascertain if condition is acute or chronic (&gt; 6 weeks).
2. Ascertain:
   - Duration of the skin eruptions. How long does the lesions last?
       - if it is &gt;24 hours, then urticaria is excluded. 
       - Lesions lasting longer than 24 hours and resolving with residual pigmentation are more likely to be urticarial vasculitis
   - Morphology of eruptions. 
     - Small papular wheal with flare, localized around sweat ducts, precipitated and aggravated by sweating - consider cholinergic urticaria
   - Ascertain if there is any periorbital or perioral swelling or dyspnea with attacks suggestive of angioedema; any associated abdominal cramps/diarrhoea with attacks.
3. Look for a family history of urticaria and familial angioedema or atopy
4. Ascertain the possible causes of the urticaria:
   - Drug ingestion
   - Infection
    - Parasitic infestation
    - Underlying systemic disease
    - Insect bites reaction
    - Physical causes eg heat, cold, visible light, water, pressure (light and heavy)
    - Food, food preservatives and food dyes
    - Contact urticaria</p>
<p><strong>Physical examination</strong></p>
<p>Exclude underlying systemic diseases e.g. infections, atopic eczema, collagen disease etc.

<p>When cutaneous vasculitis is suspected, work-up and investigations are geared towards confirming the diagnosis of vasculitis, eliciting the cause or triggers and screening for systemic involvement or complications.
1. Confirm Diagnosis 
     - Skin Histology
       - Definitive diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis
       - Size of vessels involved
       - Associated inflammatory infiltrate
     - Direct immunofluorescence (DIF)
       - DIF studies complement the information obtained by histology

<p>Blisters, scars, generally on sun-exposed areas</p>
<p>Porphyrias are hereditary or acquired disorders of heme synthesis. 
- Enzyme deficiencies in the early steos of porphyrin synthesis (e.g. acute intermittent porphyria) cause abdominal pain and neuropsychiatric manifestations (e.g psychosis, neuropathy() 
- Abnormalities in the later steps (e.g. PCT) lead to photossenitivity due to accumulation of porphyrinogens that react with oxygen on excitation by ultraviolet light.<br />
Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common porphyria, and it is due to deficiency of uroporhyrinogen decarbocylase.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Feature</strong>
- Painless blisters that heal with scarring, as well as hypopigmentation / hyperpigmentation on sun-exposed skin (e.g. back of hands, forearms, face)
- It can be triggered by ingestion of certain substances (e.g. ethanol, estrogens)
- Associated conditions
  - Heptitis C
  - HIV
  - Excessive alcohol consumption
  - Estrogen use
  - smoking</p>

<p>Dermatomyositis is a rare inflammatory disease. Common symptoms of dermatomyositis include a distinctive skin rash, muscle weakness, and inflammatory myopathy, or inflamed muscles. It's one of only three known inflammatory myopathies. </p>
<p>The condition can affect adults and children. In adults, dermatomyositis usually occurs from the late 40s to early 60s. In children, it most often appears between 5 and 15 years of age. Dermatomyositis affects more females than males.</p>
<p>There's no cure for dermatomyositis, but periods of symptom improvement (remission) can occur. Treatment can clear the skin rash and help you regain muscle strength and function.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong></p>
<p>The most common signs and symptoms of dermatomyositis include:
- Skin changes. A violet-colored or dusky red rash develops, most commonly on your face and eyelids and on knuckles (Gotton's papules), elbows, knees, chest and back. The rash, which can be itchy and painful, is often the first sign of dermatomyositis.
  <img alt="Gotton's Papules" src="../figures/skin-gottronspapules.jpg" />
- Muscle weakness. Progressive muscle weakness involves the muscles closest to the trunk, such as those in your hips, thighs, shoulders, upper arms and neck. The weakness affects both the left and right sides of your body, and tends to gradually worsen.</p>

<h4 id="peripheral-vascular-disease">Peripheral vascular disease<a class="headerlink" href="#peripheral-vascular-disease" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>This is a common complication of diabetes. The toes feel cold, the skin shiny with loss of hair and the nails dystrophic. Progression of macroangiopathy results in gangrene and ulceration.</p>
<h4 id="diabetic-dermopathy">Diabetic dermopathy.<a class="headerlink" href="#diabetic-dermopathy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>This is is found in 60% of male diabetics and 30% of female diabetics. This is attributed to microangiopathy and correlates significantly to diabetic retinopathy. These “shin spots” begin as red-brown papules that evolve into circumscribed atrophic hyperpigmented areas, which may be mildly scaly.</p>
<h4 id="diabetic-peripheral-neuropathy">Diabetic peripheral neuropathy<a class="headerlink" href="#diabetic-peripheral-neuropathy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>It results in sensory loss and neurotropic ulcers develop on pressure points of the feet. Autonomic neuropathy leads to dry skin from lack of sweating.</p>
<h4 id="acanthosis-nigricans">Acanthosis nigricans<a class="headerlink" href="#acanthosis-nigricans" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>There are many conditions associated with this pigmented velvety thickening of the skin, particularly in skin folds. Diabetes is one, attributed to insulin resistance. High insulin level has been postulated to stimulate insulin like growth factors on keratinocytes; Increased levels of insulin and/or insulin-like growth factors are thought to stimulate epidermal and dermal proliferation. </p>
<h4 id="necrobiosis-lipoidica-diabeticorum">Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum<a class="headerlink" href="#necrobiosis-lipoidica-diabeticorum" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>This occurs in less than 1% of diabetics. It is rarely seen in local (Singapore) diabetics. The lesions are usually limited to one or both shins. They have shiny yellowish atrophic centers, which may ulcerate.</p>
<h4 id="diabetic-thick-skin">Diabetic thick skin<a class="headerlink" href="#diabetic-thick-skin" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Up to one third of diabetics have thick, tight waxy skin on the dorsum of their hands. Thickening may be manifested as “pebbling” of fingers near the knuckle pads. Long-standing young insulin-dependent diabetics also have limited joint mobility, demonstrable by an inability to flatten the hands on a plane surface.
Thickening of the skin of the neck and upper back is called scleredema, not to be confused with scleroderma. This condition occurs mainly in the obese male, non-insulin dependent (Type II) diabetic. Unlike the post-streptococcal type, scleredema diabeticorum tends to be chronic.</p>
<h4 id="eruptive-xanthomas">Eruptive xanthomas<a class="headerlink" href="#eruptive-xanthomas" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Uncontrolled diabetes leads to hypertriglyceridemia. This in turn may lead to eruptive xanthomas. These appear in crops of reddish yellow papules, especially on the buttocks, shoulders, elbows, but may be on any parts of the body. Once the diabetes is controlled and serum triglycerides normalize, the xanthomas gradually regress.</p>
<h4 id="diabetic-bullae">Diabetic bullae<a class="headerlink" href="#diabetic-bullae" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>These are painless, noninflammatory, often large and asymmetrical blisters which appear on the soles and sides of the feet, although rarely may appear in other locations. These are tense (subepidermal) bullae which heal within a few weeks without scarring.</p>
<h4 id="diabetic-rubeosis">Diabetic rubeosis<a class="headerlink" href="#diabetic-rubeosis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>This refers to the red (flushed) faces attributed to decreased vascular tone.</p>
<p>Adverse cutaneous reactions to treatment in diabetics occur frequently.
Allergic reactions to insulin may be local or systemic. Local cutaneous reactions are common, and may be immediate or delayed. Early reactions manifest as urticarial wheals at the injection site 20 to 30 minutes after injection. Delayed reactions present as pruritus or painful indurated lesions on injection sites. Systemic allergic reactions to insulin are rare and manifest as widespread urticaria, angioedema and/or anaphylaxis. Both lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy may occur in injections sites, the former being more frequent. With the introduction of highly purified or synthetic human insulins, these abnormalities have become uncommon.
The oral hypoglycaemic agents, mainly the sulfonylureas, cause a variety of adverse reactions: exanthema, urticaria, or photodermatitis. Chlorpropamide, in particular, can induce unpleasant flushing following ethanol ingestion.</p>

<p>The skin is a common primary target of an adverse drug reaction (ADR). Nevertheless, systemic manifestation are not uncommon- these include fever, arthritis, hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis and hematological disorders e.g. eosinophilia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia.</p>
<p>Recognising a severe adverse drug reaction is of critical importance as it can be life-threatening and have medico-legal consequences.</p>
<h3 id="approach-to-drug-eruptions">Approach to Drug Eruptions<a class="headerlink" href="#approach-to-drug-eruptions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Some eruptions are not always caused by drugs
  e.g. exanthem or urticaria may be infection related
Difficult to identify the offending drug with certainty
Patients with suspected drugs may need some time to sort out in cases of polypharmacy</p>
<h4 id="evaluation-of-suspected-adr">Evaluation of Suspected ADR<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluation-of-suspected-adr" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Determine morphology of the eruption</li>
</ol>
<p>This influences the prognosis and narrows down the list of drugs which may be the cause Consider differential diagnoses eg. infectious exanthema or acute urticaria due to infection. Immune blistering disorders eg bullous pemphigoid, acute lupus can mimic SJS/TEN</p>
<ol>
<li>Drug history</li>
</ol>
<p>Comprehensive history-taking is required. The exact date of onset and progression of the rash is vital. A thorough list of drugs taken with date of initiation of each drug is essential- this may require looking through patients’ electronic medical records, contacting the patient’s general practitioner or other doctors, and correlation of drug exposure with the patient and relatives.</p>
<p>Be clear of the indications of the suspected drugs- if not indicated, the drug should be stopped.</p>
<ol>
<li>Previous Experience with the Drug (epidemiological data)</li>
</ol>
<p>The specific morphologic pattern may increase or decrease the likelihood that a given drug is responsible for a given reaction. Eg DRESS is more likely to be caused by anticonvulsants than antihistamines for example. This helps to narrow down the list of possible causative drugs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dechallenge</li>
</ol>
<p>Most ADRs improve with the removal of the suspected drug. A reaction is unlikely to be drug-related if improvement does not occur after the dechallenge and appropriate therapy. Note that some ADRs eg DRESS take several weeks to resolve.</p>
<ol>
<li>Alternative Drug</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider equivalent alternative drugs. Be aware of cross-reactivity (eg. Pencillins) and chemical structure similarity (eg cetirizine and hydroxyzine)</p>
<ol>
<li>Determining drug causality</li>
</ol>
<p>This may be difficult in the acute situation when multiple drugs are used within the same time frame. Further evaluation to determine drug cause may be done after the acute phase has resolved. Depending on the type of reaction and type of drug, skin tests eg. patch test or prick/intradermal tests may be performed. Systemic drug provocation test remains the gold standard for establishing drug causality but is contraindicated in severe ADRs eg SJS/TEN.</p>

<h3 id="fixed-drug-eruption">Fixed Drug Eruption<a class="headerlink" href="#fixed-drug-eruption" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Fixed drug eruptions (FDE) are distinctive because they recur on the same sites every time upon exposure to the same drug. Onset is usually rapid, within 30mins up to a few days. More lesions can appear with subsequent episodes. Lesions resolve typically with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation which may be persistent.</p>
<p>The term fixed drug eruption (FDE) describes the development of one or more annular or oval erythematous patches as a result of systemic exposure to a drug; these reactions normally resolve with hyperpigmentation and may recur at the same site with reexposure to the drug because it involves resident memory T cells. Thus the name fixed. Repeated exposure to the offending drug may cause new lesions to develop in addition to "lighting up" the older hyperpigmented lesions.</p>
<p>Acute onset of erythematous, round plaques, oval in shape
Occasionally vesiculobullous
Recur at the same site with each intake of drug
Within 30 minutes to a few days of drug exposure
Hands, feet, glans penis, perioral are common sites
Characteristic hyperpigmentation. 
Common causes are NSAIDs, paracetamol, tetracyclines and penicillins.</p>
<p>Note fixed food /drink eruption from quinin in Soda water; and fixed solar eruption.</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and stop the drug. </li>
<li>Topical or systemic steroids may be used for faster resolution of the rash.</li>
<li>Octenidine dihydrochloride is a cationic surfactant, with a gemini-surfactant structure, derived from pyridine. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

<p>Stevens-Johnson Syndrome &amp; Toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is the most severe cutaneous adverse drug reaction. It constitutes a spectrum of disease ranging from mild (SJS) to severe (TEN), based on body surface area involvement. By definition, SJS involves &lt; 10% BSA, TEN involves &gt;30% BSA and SJS-TEN overlap involves 10-30% BSA.</p>
<p>Clinically, it can resemble thermal burns but differs as it involves only the epidermis. Causes include allopurinol, anti-convulsants, NSAIDs and Bactrim. Onset of rash is usually 5-28 days after drug use. A minority are caused by infection eg. Mycoplasma pneumonia. Up to 30% remain idiopathic.
Mortality depends on extent of involvement and can be up to 30%.</p>

<p>Also known as drug hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). </p>
<p>More serious.</p>
<p>Onset of rash is later then SJS/TEN – often 2 to 6 weeks after drug exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Feature</strong>
- The patient presents with fever, an extensive rash (pustules) and lymphadenopathy. 
- Blood test abnormalities may include eosinophilia, deranged liver function tests and renal impairment among others.
- Often has facial edema</p>
<p>Common culprit:
- carbamazepine, allopurinol, NSAIDs, antibiotics, indomethacine</p>
<p><strong>Prognosis</strong>
Resolution of rash is also delayed, often &gt; 2weeks, and occasionally several months after stopping the drug.
Mortality is around 5-10% from liver failure, renal failure or other organ involvement. </p>
<p>Anticonvulsants, Dapsone, Bactrim and allopurinol are common causes.</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
Treatment is dependent on severity of disease. Topical steroids if there is only cutaneous involvement. Systemic steroids are required if there is significant organ involvement.
- withdrawal of drug
- topical corticosteroids
- prednisolone may be considered in severe cases
- cyclosporin in severe cases</p>

<p>An adverse drug eruption is an undesirable clinical manifestation resulting from administration of a particular drug.
Different drugs can give rise to a single type of cutaneous reaction. One drug can give rise to various patterns of eruptions</p>
<p>Type | Drugs
|---|---
Psoriasiform eruptions | beta-blockers captopril chloroquine lithium
Pityriasis rosea-like eruptions | barbiturates bismuth beta-blockers captopril gold salts metronidazole
Lichenoid eruptions | beta-blockers captopril carbamazepine methyldopa phenothiazines penicillamine quinidine sulfonylureas tetracycline thiazides</p>

<p>Aka
erythroderma is characterized by widespread erythema and scaling involving BSA&gt;90%. Drugs eg. anti-TB drugs must be excluded. Other causes of GED must be considered – these include severe atopic eczema or psoriasis and cutaneous T cell lymphoma.</p>
<h3 id="photosensitivity">Photosensitivity<a class="headerlink" href="#photosensitivity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Common drugs associated with photosensitivity reactions
|Class | Drug
|----|----|
Antibiotics | Tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline)
Antipsychotics | Chloropramazine, prochlorperazine
Diuretics | Furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide
Others | Amiodarone, promethazine, piroxicam</p>
<p>Drug-induced photosensitivity requires sunlight to interact with the drug concerned to produce the adverse reaction. Thiazides, sulfonylureas, phenothiazines and NSAIDs are common causes of acute drug-induced phototoxicity.</p>
<p>Phototoxic drug reactions result from production of reactive oxygen species by the interaction of drug metabolites with ultraviolet radiation. Thse reactive oxygen products then directly damage cell membranes and DNA. Symptoms resemble commoon subnburn, with erythema, pain, and bullae formation in sun-exposed areas. However, the ractionms may have exaggerated severity, and the solar exposure needed to cause symptoms may be much less than that needed to cause nonphototoxic sunburn. </p>
<p>Patients being prescribed implicated drugs should be advised to minimize sun exposure and use appropriate sunscreens and barrier solar protection when outdoors.</p>
<p>Topical and systemic medications can also cause photoallergic reactions, in which ultraviolet light alters the structure of the drug, which then induces a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. These skin manifestations are typically eczematous in appearance. Prior sensitization is required for a photoallergic response, but not a phototoxic reaction.</p>
<h3 id="drug-induced-hypersensitivity-type-i">Drug-induced Hypersensitivity Type I<a class="headerlink" href="#drug-induced-hypersensitivity-type-i" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Due to formation of drug-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) on exposure to a medication, although most do not. Once formed, the drug-specific IgE occupies receptors on mast cells an basophils. If the drug is encountered again, these cells may activate, resulting in symptoms. Onset is rapid (within seconds to minutes), and symptoms can range from mild (e.g.urticaria, pruritus, flushing) to more severe (e.g. angioedema of the larynx, anaphylaxis). Most commonly implicated in type 1 reactinos are beta lactam drugs, neuromuscular blocking agents, quinolones, platinum-containing chemotherapeutic agents, and foreign proteins (e.g. chimeric antibodies).</p>
<p>Urticaria and pruritus without systemic symptoms are usually treated with antihistamines, and treatment with the offending drug is discontinued. </p>
<p>Treatment with epinephrine and corticosteroids is reserved for more severe reactions accompanied by systemic systems (e.g. anaphylaxis). Patients requiring such therapy usually have respiratory symptoks (dyspnea, wheeze, stridor) or abdominal symptoms (diarrhea, cramps), unstable vital signs (hypotension) and hypoxia.</p>
<h2 id="eczema">Eczema 湿疹<a class="headerlink" href="#eczema" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Eczema (aka dermatitis) is the most common skin condition seen at NSC. These HAVE TO BE ITCHY! So look for excorations.</p>
<p>Eczema is an inflammation of the skin caused by a variety of internal and/or external stimuli. Therefore, ezcema should always be classified into either Endogenous or Exogenous eczema. </p>
<p>Endogenous Ezema | Exogenous Eczema
|----|------
Atopic,<br> discoid,<br> seborrhoeic,<br> stasis,<br> asteatotic,<br> lichen simplex chronicus,<br> pompholynx | Allergic contact dermatitis,<br> irritant contact dermatitis, <br>photodermatitis</p>
<p>Ezcema is not static. The reaction in the skin can be acute, subacute or chronic depending on the strength and duration of the stimuli. 
- Acute eczema is characterized by oedema, vesicle /bullae formation, oozing and crusting. 
- Chronic eczema is characterised by thickening of the skin,lichenification, and pigmentary disturbances. 
- In an intermediate form called subacute dermatitis, the chief manifestations are erythema and scaling, but may display both vesiculation and thickening of the skin.
Patient may have acute exacerbation of chronic eczema etc. </p>
<p>The diagnosis of the type of eczema is based on 
- its onset
- its association with contactants
- its association with ultraviolet lights
- its morphology
- its distribution
- its evolution
- its associated personal and family history</p>
<h3 id="endogenous-eczema">Endogenous Eczema<a class="headerlink" href="#endogenous-eczema" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Endogenous eczema should be classified according to type.</p>
<p>Eczema | Age of Onset | Morphology | Distribution
|---|---|---|---
Seborrhoeic | 2 peaks - early infacy, elderly | Greasy yellowish scales on ill-defined erythematous plaques| Scalp, eyebrows, nasolabial folds, ears, presternal, interscapular, axillae, groin
Atopic | Childhood | Subacute to chronic eczema | Infancy – cheeks, extensor of limbs Childhood – periorbital, neck, flexures of limbs, wrists, ankles, buttocks Adulthood – forehead, neck, flexures of limbs, hands, feet
Discoid | Childrean, young adults | Round, crusted red plaques | Limbs &gt;&gt; trunk, face
Pompholyx | Young adults | Vesicles | Hands, feet
Lichen simplex chronicus | Adulthood | Well demarcated, lichenified and thick |Anogenital region, back of neck, front of ankle
Stasis/ venous | Middle-age to elderly adults | Scaly erythematous plaques with surrounding hyperpigmentation | Lower legs, especially over the medial malleolus, and feet
Asteatotic | Elderly | Dry, erythematous plaques; scaling with a ‘crazy-paving’ pattern of fissuring | Limbs &gt; trunk</p>
<h4 id="seborrhoeic-eczema">Seborrhoeic Eczema<a class="headerlink" href="#seborrhoeic-eczema" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>This is a common chronic dermatitis characterized by erythema and yellowish greasy scaling that occurs in areas of the body rich in sebaceous glands such as the scalp and face.
- onset: usually infancy (craddle cap) and post middle age.
- distribution: seborrhoeic areas - scalp, face, axillae, groins, chest, back.
- morphology: scaly eczema with greasy scaling, Excessive dandruff with an itchy, scaly, greasy, erythematous eruption affecting the scalp, eyebrows, ears and nasolabial folds
- Imflammation to yeast on the skin</p>
<p>Incidence of SD peaks in the first year of life and again in adulthood.  SD is associated with colonization by Malassezia species and primarily affects areas with numerous sebaceous glands.  In infants, these areas include the scalp ("cradle cap") (red circle), eyelids, nasolabial folds, postauricular area, and umbilicus.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
- 2 age groups are affected: Infants (6 weeks to 6 months), Adults
- There are 2 common patterns:
  1. Scalp and facial involvement
  2. A dry eczema over the presternal/interscapular area: Flexural area, axillae, inframammary areas and groin are affected by a moist, red and sore intertrigo, often secondarily colonized by Candida albicans.</p>

<img alt="seborrhoeic eczema" src="../figures/skin-seborrheic-dermatitis-2.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Etiology</strong>
Endogenous, genetic factors and an overgrowth of Pityrosporum ovale, which is a commensal yeast, seems to be involved in the pathogenesis. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is more common in Down syndrome, Parkinson’s disease and in patients with AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>
- peaks in infancy and adulthood
- Erythematous plaques /patches and/or yellow, greasy scales
- mild pruritus may be present
- Located on scalp, face, umbilicus, diaper area
- Pediatric seborrheic dermatitis most commonly presents in infancy with cradle cap or moist-appearing erythema along the skin folds (eg, neck, axillae, thighs).  Patients are typically asymptomatic. </p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Clinical</p>
<p><strong>Differential Diagnosis</strong>
- Psoriasis may be difficult to distinguish from seborrhoeic dermatitis. In psoriasis, the lesions are well demarcated with large coarse silvery scales, whereas in seborrhoeic dermatitis, they are more diffuse with greasy yellowish scales.
- Langerhans cell histocytosis is a rare disease that mimics infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis. Nodules, petechiae, purpura within the areas of persistent dermatitis, or visceral involvement eg hepatosplenomegaly should alert the physician to this diagnosis.
- Tinea capitis may resemble seborrhoeic dermatitis on the scalp. In tinea capitis, there may be broken off hairs; a fungal culture will often be positive.</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
- Treatment
  - Treatment is not always necessary as spontaneous resolution is common
  - First line: emolients, nonmedicated shampoos
  - Second line: topical antifungals or low potency glucocorticoids
    - Medicated shampoos (eg those containing coal tar), are helpful. 
    - Moderately potent topical steroid scalp preparations such as betamethasone valerate scalp lotion may be needed to reduce the redness, pruritus and scaling.
    - Facial lesions respond to 1% hydrocortisone et vioform cream bid. 
    - Avoid prolonged use of fluorinated steroids on the face.
- Health Risk Management
  - Look for signs and symptoms of Down syndrome, Parkinson’s disease and in patients with AIDS</p>

Pathogenesis involves epidermal dysfunction due to improper synthesis of stratum corneum components.  Allergens can enter the disrupted skin barrier and generate an inflammatory response.  Excessive bathing, dry environments, stress, overheating, and irritating detergents can trigger flares.</p>
<p>Atopic dermatitis in infancy presents with pruritus, and scaly erythematous lesions on the face, chest, and extensor surfaces of the extremities.  Flexural involvement is common in children and adults.  Topical emollients are the first-line treatment.</p>
<p>Atopy is a familial hypersensitivity of skin and mucous membrane associated with increased IgE production. The clinical manifestations of atopy are asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhino-conjunctivitis.</p>
<p><strong>Epidemiology</strong></p>
<p>Atopic dermatitis is a widely prevalent disease, more prevalent in urban areas and in higher socio- economic class.
Prevalence is increasing in developed countries.
Both sexes are equally affected</p>
<p><strong>Pathogenesis</strong></p>
<p>The normal skin is a strong bricks - corneocytes, good morta  = epidermal lipids, no water loss, prevents entry of allergens. In Eczematous skin this is failing aparts, making it more likely for our skin to be attacked.</p>
<p>The pathogenesis of AD is a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors which induce skin barrier dysfunction and immunological abnormalities. Studies have shown that null mutations in the filaggrin gene cause ichthyosis vulgaris and predispose to AD. Recently, a study investigating the spectrum of FLG-null mutations in Singaporean Chinese patients with ichthyosis vulgaris and/or moderate-to-severe AD showed a wider genetic landscape of FLG-null mutations.
Immune response in atopic dermatitis skin.</p>
<p>Immunological triggers like food and aeroallergens eg. house dust mite, products of Staphylococcus aureus start an inflammatory cascade of TH2 type cytokines (eg. interleukins 4, 5, 13). The IL-4 and IL-5 contribute to mast cell liberation of histamine and increased eosinophils. T cell infiltration in acute lesions of atopic dermatitis is associated with a predominance of TH2 cytokines, whereas maintenance of chronic inflammation is associated with both TH2 and TH1 (eg. interferon gamma) cytokines. The persistent skin inflammation in chronic atopic dermatitis is linked to the prolonged survival of eosinophils and macrophages in atopic skin. Most patients with atopic dermatitis have peripheral blood eosinophilia and increased serum IgE levels.
Skin barrier function.</p>
<p>Atopic dermatitis skin has a marked decrease in barrier function associated with reduced ceramide levels and enhanced transepidermal water loss. These changes likely contribute to increased antigen absorption into the skin. It also increases the likelihood of S aureus colonization. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Progression</strong>
- The majority of patients have an onset of atopic dermatitis in early childhood. About 60% present before the first year of life. Adult-onset atopic dermatitis can occur but is not as common.
- The age of onset and severity of atopic dermatitis is an important prognostic factor. In general, the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis improve with age. However, severe childhood disease with early onset tends to persist into adulthood.
- Eczematous lesions usually begin with pruritus alone and evolve to erythematous papules and scaly plaques.  Severe lesions may have serous exudates and crusting. 
- Infants typically have lesions in the distribution of the face, scalp, and extensor surfaces of the extremities.  The lesions can also be seen in flexural creases in older children and adults. 
- The lesions usually last for days or weeks. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Presentation</strong>
- The sites affected vary according to age:
  - Infantil: The face, especially the cheeks, and the <strong>extensor surfaces</strong> of the limbs are often affected. The diaper area is spared (because it is moist)
  - Childhood stage: The face, especially <strong>periorbital</strong> skin and forehead, neck, <strong>flexural surfaces</strong> of the limbs and wrists. These are sometimes infected.
  - Adult stage: In adulthood, the predominant sites affected are the face, especially the forehead, neck, flexural surfaces of the limbs, hands and feet.
- Onset is usually childhood
- Distribution : face, groins (infants) flexures (childhood) 
- Morphology : 
  - itchy lichenified eczema.
  - Excoration
  - Flexor area
  - Xerosis cyst
  - Purigo nodules
    <img alt="purigo nodules" src="../figures/skin-purigonodules.jpg" />
  - Crusting scape
- often associated with other atopic disease.
- Common aggravating factors
  - Scratching
  - Dryness
  - Staphylococcal skin infection</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis by UK Working Party</strong>
- An itchy skin condition (parental report of scratching in a child)
- PLUS any of the following</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong></p>
<p>The main principles of treatment are:
- Identify and eliminate trigger factors, food allergies, aeroallergens 
- Patient education and counselling
  - Patient education is important as it can contribute effectively in preventing complications, improving the quality of life and treatment adherence.
  - Behavioural modification, relaxation, stress relief programs are helpful.
  - Nurse educators teach on the disease pathogenesis, appropriate use of steroids and skin care.
- Scoring system exists, e.g. SCORAD - most prcise and specific scoring system to determine the 
- Proactive Therapy
  - Long term, topical antiinflammatory applied to previously affected area twice a wek combined with liberal use of emollients. 
  - Moderate to severe atopic eczema with frequent relapses
- Normal-looking skin of patients with AD is characterized by a barrier defect and a subclinical eczematous skin reaction
- In the case of acute flare-ups, paients may benefit a short course of systemic corticosteroids but long term use should be avoided. </p>
<p>Agents that can be used
- Treating the dry skin with moisturizing soaps and moisturizers; e,g,
  - Aids in restoring the impaired barrier function of the epidermis
  - Reduce the itch of dry skin
  - Increase the efficacy of topical steroids
  - Steroid sparing effect
  - Frequently and liberately: don't only use a little bit of expensive; think cost effectiveness
    - Humanctant function - urea/ glycerine
    - Occlusive - paraffin
    - Ceramite - in expensive moisturiers to minimic skin lipids
- Treating the inflammation with topical steroids
  - Aqueous cream, urea cream, white soft paraphine, liquid paraphine
  - Mainstay fo treatment in atopic dermatitis
    - Proactive approach is to prevent flaring
    - Steroid only to affected area and then moisturizers to more places focusing on the dry
    - Don't assume that lower percentage is less potent
    - Use mild steroids on face, neck, groin axilla
    - Increase potency where skin is thicker
  - Worry side effects: minimize use in special locations such as face and groin.
    - Telangiectasia, striae, atrophy, purpura are common problems when potent topical steroids are used for prolonged periods of time
    - Glaucoma can occur after prolonged or excessive periocular application
    - Tachyphylaxis with chronic usage
    - The signs and symptoms of infections like impetigo, dermatophyte infections (“tinea incognito”) and scabies may be masked
    - Uncommonly allergic contact dermatitis to topical steroids or a component of the vehicle (eg. preservative)
    - Systemic side effects like pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, weight gain, poor growth, glycosuria, Cushing syndrome can occur, especially in children
  - Application
    - 1 fingertip unit = tip of adult index finger to first crease, contains about 0.5 g, and enough to cover aree of 1 flat adult hands.
    - Reactive therapy: Twice daily appliaction to affected skin only and stopped or tapered down once visible lesions have cleared. To taper:
      - Use a less potent steroid on a daily basis
      - Keep more potent one while reducing the frequency of application (intermittent regimen)
    - Proactive therapy: For recurring lesions
      - A combination of predefined, long term, low dose anti-inflammatory treatment (topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors) applied to previously affected areas of skin in combination with liberal use of emollients. 
      - The proactive, usually twice weekly treatment regimen is started after all lesions have been successfully treated. 
      - The aim of this is to induce long term remission as normal looking, non- lesional skin of atopic dermatitis patients is immunobiologically not normal but characterized by an invisible inflammation and barrier defect.
      - Do it for 1 or 2 months; if required for more than 3 months, something is wrong and need to be reviewed. </p>

<li>Histamine is not the only mediator of itch in atopic eczema so it is not that useful for itch</li>
<li>It is useful for controlly urticaria and allergic rhinitis at the same time, say if the patient is having problem sleeping during post nasal drop. Some antihistamine can help to dampen the symptoms. It is important to treat the skin inflammation rather than rely on antihistamine for symptom relief.</li>
<li>Antihistamines contribute to sedation. The use of a sedative antihistamine before bedtime may promote restful sleep.</li>
<li>Examples of sedating anti histamines are: chlorpheniramine, hydroxyzine</li>
<li>Appropriate use of antibiotics in staphylococcal infections </li>
<li>Staphyloccocus aureus often colonizes atopic dermatitis lesions. </li>
<li>Heavy colonization and infection cause atopic dermatitis to be oozy, and recalcitrant to topical treatment. </li>
<li>A short course of anti- Staphylococcal antibiotics is needed in such circumstances eg cloxacillin and cephalexin. </li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Triggers</strong>
- House Mite Allergy
  - Hypersensitivity to HDM can give rise to eczematous lesions
  - HDM is also an aggravating factors in AD patients, and becomes increasingly relevant during childhood and adolescence
  - Patient may present with contact dermatitis, or sneezing in dusty places
  - Allergy test is a marker of sensitization
- Food allergy
  - Usually in children with gut symptoms and poorly controlled eczema; 
  - Should already be known in adults
  - Skin prick test test for type I hypersensitivity / immediate, not delayed, Patch test for delayed. </p>
<p><strong>Complication</strong>
- Eczema Herpaticum
  - A dreaded complication is the appearance of herpes simplex virus infection on atopic dermatitis lesions. The onset is heralded by a sudden appearance of multiple painful vesicles, "punched-out" erosions, and hemorrhagic crusting on erythematous skin along with fever and lymphadenopathy.
  - Can spread very rapidly
  - Most cases are due to infection by HSV
  - Treatment: Urgent treatment with antivirals is necessary, in the form of systemic acyclovir or valaciclovir ie. acyclovir 400 mg 3 times per day x 1 week, or valaciclovir 500 mg bd x 1 week
- Cellulitis/abscess
- Discomfort interfering with daily activities &amp;  sleep</p>
<h4 id="discoid-or-nummular-eczema">Discoid or Nummular Eczema<a class="headerlink" href="#discoid-or-nummular-eczema" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Nummular eczema is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder that most commonly affects the skin and extremities. The incidence is highest in middle aged and older individuals. The cause is uncertain but frequent occurrence in the setting of chronically dry skin suggests decreased production of skin lipids. The name refers to the characteristic round lesions that would fit under a large coin (nummum is Latin for 'coin).</p>
<ul>
<li>onset: adolescent</li>
<li>distribution: limbs, occasionally trunk.</li>
<li>morphology: coin shaped/discoid subacute eczematous plaques</li>
<li>associated with atopic eczema occasionally. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="discoid eczema" src="../figures/skin-nummular-eczema.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
Discoid eczema occur in all age groups but particularly in young adults. 
- It is characterized by circular, sharply demarcated, symmetrically distributed areas of dermatitis 
- Occurring primarily on the extremities although the trunk can also be involved. 
- Patients often present initially with pruritic, scaly, fissured, crusted and oozy plaques (intermittent exudate).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
Primarily based on clinical findings
Biopsy can be considered in atypical cases, but most plaques improve with empiric therapy, eliminating the need for extensive diagnostic testing. </p>
<p><strong>Differential Diagnosis</strong>
Tinea corporis may be excluded by a KOH examination of skin scrapings.
Psoriasis may simulate discoid eczema but the former has adherent silvery white scales. Allergic contact dermatitis to nickel which may have a discoid pattern of dermatitis, will be identified with Patch testing</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
- Patient should be informed of the chronicity of discoid eczema, and its tendency to recur.
- Counseling on measures to reduce xerosis (e.g. emollients, minimizing use of harsh soaps)
  - Treat dry skin: emollients, and avoidance of harsh soap
  - Potassium permanganate compresses as an astringent is helpful in oozy lesions. In cases that are secondarily infected, an oral course of cloxacillin, cephalexin or erythromycin for one to two weeks is useful. 
- First line: topical glucocorticoids (e.g. betamethasone dipropionate)
  - A moderately potent or potent topical steroid twice a day is helpful. 
- At times, a short course of oral prednisolone may be given. 
- Sedating antihistamines eg. hydroxyzine given at night may help to relieve the pruritus.</p>
<h4 id="stasis-eczema">Stasis Eczema<a class="headerlink" href="#stasis-eczema" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>onset : old age</li>
<li>morphology : pigmented eczematous eruptions around ankles</li>
<li>distribution : especially medial malleolus</li>
<li>usually associated with ankle edema, varicosities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
This is a chronic dermatitis of the lower legs seen in persons with chronic venous insufficiency eg varicose veins and after deep vein thrombosis. Most patients are middle-aged or elderly. Dilated venules and hyperpigmentation (from extravasated red blood cells) around the ankles are early signs. The eczema affects the inner lower leg with erythema and scaling. Oedema, ulceration and induration are often associated.
The most common site of ulceration is over the medial malleolus. Stasis ulcers are commonly single and although they may be extremely large, they are relatively pain-free, in contrast to arterial ulcers.</p>
<p><strong>Etiology</strong>
Increased venous pressure due to venous hypertension increases the hydrostatic pressure in the dermal capillaries resulting in an escape of fibrinogen leading to the deposition of a fibrin sheath around the capillaries. The sheath impedes the diffusion of oxygen and other nutrients into the tissues, leading to the clinical changes.</p>
<p><strong>Differential Diagnosis</strong>
Venous ulcers can be differentiated from other ulcers by history, site and additional signs. In the absence of the typical hyperpigmentation and venous stasis, one should consider other causes of ulcers eg 
- arterial ulcers (deep and painful ulcers)
- vasculitic ulcers 
- pyoderma gangrenosum
- squamous cell carcinoma
- lipodermosclerosis: inverted champagn bottle appearanace, lower layer is constricted, it is a panniculitis with fibrosis from the lower layer, and is painful, unlike eczema.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>
- General measures to reduce venous pressure are important. 
  - The patient should minimize prolonged standing. 
  - Walking is encouraged because muscle action pumps blood through the veins. 
  - Advise the patient to elevate the feet when sitting or sleeping. 
  - Surgical support stockings are helpful to minimize dilation of the veins.
- If the dermatitis is oozy
  - potassium permanganate soaks bid for 15 minutes is helpful. 
  - Prescribe moderately potent topical steroids (eg 0.1% betamethasone cream bid). 
  - When the dermatitis improves, use a milder topical steroid (eg 1⁄4 str betamethasone cream bid) together with moisturizers. 
  - If secondary infection is present, prescribe systemic antistaphylococcal antibiotics (eg cloxacillin, cephalexin or erythromycin) for 1-2 weeks.
- For ulcers
  - daily normal saline soaks and TG dressings are helpful. 
  - Hydrocolloid dressings may be used for clean ulcers to promote granulation.
- Allergic contact dermatitis to medicaments is common in stasis eczema and should be considered if the condition does not respond to treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points</strong>
- onset : usually old age
- morphology : cracked, scaly eczema with erythema, discoid or confluent
- distribution : legs and forearms.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
- This is a dry skin dermatitis that occurs on the limbs and sometimes trunk of elderly people. 
- It may be caused by reduced surface lipids in the skin in elderly people and is exacerbated by excessive washing, dry climates, hypothyroidism and use of diuretics.
- The skin is erythematous, dry and scaling with a ‘crazy-paving’ pattern of fissuring. The limbs are particularly affected.</p>
<p><img alt="Asteatotic Eczema" src="../figures/skin-asteatotic-eczema.jpeg" />
<img alt="Asteatotic Eczema" src="../figures/skin-asteatotic-eczema-2.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>
- relieving the dryness. 
- Medicated soaps should be stopped. 
- Prescribe emulsifying ointment as a soap followed by liberal application of moisturizers (eg aqueous cream, 10% Urea cream). 
- Prescribe mild topical steroid ointments bid until the eczematous component has resolved.</p>
<h4 id="lichen-simplex-chronicus">Lichen simplex chronicus<a class="headerlink" href="#lichen-simplex-chronicus" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Also known as neurodermatitis. Characterized by thickened, excoriated plaques caused by persistent scratching and rubbing. 
<strong>Key Points</strong>
- onset : any age
- morphology : circumscribed, localised lichenified plaques of chronic eczema
- distribution : ankles, forearms, neck, scrotum</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
- This is a circumscribed area of lichenified eczema due to repeated rubbing or scratching, as a habit or due to stress or ther eczema.
- Areas typically affected are the anogenital region, back of the neck and the fronts of the ankles, sites accessible to scratching.
- It is associated with anxiety disorders and typically occurs in areas that easy to reach.</p>
<p><img alt="lichen simplex chronicus" src="../figures/skin-lichen_simplex_chronicus_high.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>
- This is designed to break the <em>itch-scratch cycle</em>.
- Make the patient aware of the role of rubbing in maintaining the disease and that this has to be stopped.
- A potent topical steroid is needed.</p>
<h4 id="pityriasis-alba">Pityriasis Alba<a class="headerlink" href="#pityriasis-alba" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A type of dermatitis, commonly seen in children and young adults as dry, fine-scaled, pale patches on the face. It is self-limiting and usually only requires use of moisturizer creams.
- Differential with tinea vesicolor</p>
<h4 id="pompholyx-dyshidrotic-eczema">Pompholyx (Dyshidrotic Eczema)<a class="headerlink" href="#pompholyx-dyshidrotic-eczema" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Dyshidrotic eczema is a common, although poorly understood, disorder that primarily affects the hands and feet. It is also known as acute palmoplantar eczema. The etiology is uncertain but likely multifactorial and variable; contributing factors may include irritant or allergic contact dermatitis, ultraviolet radiation, and immune reactions to remote allergens or fungi.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong>
- onset : adolescent and adults
- morphology : vesicular eczema
- distribution : fingers, hands and feet</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
- Clinicall: A recurrent, pruritic rash characterized by deep-seated vesicles that preferentially affect the palms, soles, and sides of the digits is typical.<br />
- Biopsy can be performed for confirmation but is not usually necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
- This is a special vesicular type of hand and foot eczema affecting both sexes usually before the age of 40 years.
- Clinically, crops of clear small vesicles that look like sago develop on the palms, soles and sides of the fingers and toes. These dry out after about a week and may lead to painful fissuring of the skin. 
- Attacks may recur at 3 to 4 week intervals for months or years. Later, scaling and lichenification occurs.</p>
<p><img alt="pompholyx" src="../figures/skin-pompholyx.jpg" />
<img alt="pompholyx" src="../figures/skin-pompholyx-foot.jpeg" /></p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
- Acute pompholyx requires application twice a day of wet dressings (eg potassium permanganate). 
- Once the acute stage settles, moderately potent steroid creams and emollients are useful.
  -  Patients should be counseled on the use of emollients, avoidance of irritants, and protection from cold and/or wet conditions.<br />
  - When additional intervention is needed
    - topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment; high-potency and super high–potency corticosteroids (eg, betamethasone dipropionate) are preferred.
    - Oral antibiotics (eg cloxacillin, cephalexin or erythromycin) are given for one to two weeks if bacterial infection is present. 
- Photochemotherapy eg. soak PUVA, can be considered in recalcitrant cases.</p>
<p><strong>Differential Diagnosis</strong>
- Examine the feet for tinea pedis since a fungal infection of the feet can provoke vesicles on the hands (id phenomenon). Fungal infection is unlikely if a properly done microscopy is negative for fungal elements.
- Patch testing to exclude allergic contact dermatitis is recommended for most patients with hand dermatitis.</p>

<h3 id="exogenous-eczema-contact-dermatitis">Exogenous Eczema (Contact Dermatitis)<a class="headerlink" href="#exogenous-eczema-contact-dermatitis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>An eczematous response of the skin as a result of contact with external substance(s). This is classified into 
- Irritant contact dermatitis
- Allergic contact dermatitis</p>
<h4 id="irritant-dermatitis">Irritant Dermatitis<a class="headerlink" href="#irritant-dermatitis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Occurs when external substances irritate the skin. This is a direct physical-chemical process as opposed to an allergic contact dermatitis, which occurs via a type IV delayed hypersensitivity immunological mechanism. Irritant contact dermatitis therefore has the following features:
- Irritant contact dermatitis remains localized to the area of contact with the offending irritant.
- Irritant contact dermatitis can occur in all predisposed individuals in contact with an irritant. There is no requirement of the person being previously sensitized to the substance (as opposed to allergic contact dermatitis).
- However, there is an individual susceptibility to irritant contact dermatitis. Atopics are particularly prone to irritant contact dermatitis.
- relapsing nature, improves with withdrawal and aggravated with exposure to contactant</p>
<p>Irritant contact dermatitis can be broadly classified further into 2 types:
1. Acute irritant contact dermatitis
   - caused by contact with strong irritants such as in a lab
   - sudden onset
   - usually presents with blisters, erosion, erythema and oedema
   - complete recovery on avoiding irritant
   This occurs when the skin is in contact with a fairly strong irritant eg Dithranol. The skin reacts by developing, after a short interval of time, an acute vesicular eczematous response.
2. Chronic cumulative insult irritant contact dermatitis
   - usually caused by mild irritants, such as in hand-washing
   - slow to develop, requires repeated exposures
   - presents with erythema, lichenfication, scaliness and fissuring
   - tend to be persistent
   This occurs when the skin is repeatedly in contact with a mild irritant eg water, coolant, solvents.</p>
<p>When an irritant contact dermatitis is established, it is clinically difficult to differentiate this from an allergic contact dermatitis.</p>
<h4 id="allergic-contact-dermatitis">Allergic Contact Dermatitis<a class="headerlink" href="#allergic-contact-dermatitis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Allergic contact dermatitis is a T-cell mediated delayed type hypersensitivity reaction (type IV). This type of reaction requires prior exposure to the allergen, allowing antigen-specific T cells to proliferate and , on reexposure, create a delayed inflammatory response. Classic antigens include urushiol (Toxicodendron plants [ poison ivy, oak, sumac]), nickel (jewelry, belt buckles), and neomycin (topical antibiotic).</p>
<p>Delayed type-IV hypersentivity diagnosed with a patch test. The patch is stuck on the back for 2 days. On. day 3 and 7 we check for reaction. Common trigers include nickle and hair dye. There are different panels for common causative agents.
- tends to be relapsing or persistent
- presents as acute or subacute eczema
- diagnosis can be confirmed with patch test</p>
<p>An allergic contact dermatitis has 2 phases.
1. An afferent phase (sensitization phase)</p>
<p>Sensitization is via cutaneous contact. This is a complicated process involving antigen presenting cells (Langerhans cells) presenting the antigen to T- lymphocytes in the lymph nodes. The T-cells are then converted to memory cells.</p>
<ol>
<li>An efferent phase (elicitation phase)</li>
</ol>
<p>A person who had previously been sensitized by prior cutaneous contact, on subsequent contact with the substance, manifests a type IV hypersensitivity response. Following sensitization, contact with the allergen causes pruritus and irritation. Rubber and plastic from ear buds can cause allergic contact dermatitis. </p>
<p>It is therefore clear that before a person can develop ACD to a substance, he must have had prior exposure to the substance.</p>
<p>Allergic contact dermatitis always occurs at the site of contact. Though usually confined to the site, the eczematous response may spread secondarily.</p>
<p><strong>Rash</strong>
Erythematous, indurated, scaly, plaque like rash. 
- ACD due to poison ivy exposure often causes linear lesions due to allergen inoculation into the skin by the branches and leaves of the plant. Starting 12 hours after expossure, severve pruritus and erythematous streaks develop with edema and vesicles, often leading to weeping drainage and crusting. 
- Anywhere and follows the distribution of item inducing the dermatitis.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Diagnosis is clinical</p>
<p>Patch Testing
- The patch test procedure is an invaluable tool in the assessment of contact dermatitis. It is used to confirm allergic contact dermatitis.
- Patch testing refers to the procedure of applying a small amount of a substance, at a non-irritant, non-sensitizing concentration, on an uninvolved part of the skin (usually the back). Multiple substances are often tested at one sitting. In most contact dermatitis clinics, a series of common and important allergens are grouped together as a "standard series" to be patch tested to all patients. Special substances are added according to individual circumstances. 
- Application of petrolatum containing patch testing substance should preferably be 20 mg &plusmn; 2 mg onto the Finn chamber.
- The patch test is occluded for 48 hours (removed at day 2), and read at day 3 (72 hours) and day 7 after application of patches.
- Keep test area dry for the first 48 hours, minimize perspiration and no showering.
- In a patient who is not sensitized, there will be no response. (Note that the test substance is applied at a non-irritant concentration. This concentration is determined by testing on controls). A person who is allergic to a test substance will develop a small allergic contact dermatitis response at the test site.</p>
<p>Examples of contact allergens include</p>
<p>Allergens | Reaction
|---|---
Nickel | costume jewellery, spectacle frames. 
Chronmium | cement
Epoxy resin | Industrial adhesives
Fragrances | Perfumes, skin care products
Neomycin, flavin | topical medication
Colophony | adhesive plaster, soldering flux </p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
1. Remove and avoid direct contact with offending irritant or allergen
2. First line therapies
   - Acute oozy dermatitis: potassiu permanganate compresses and a short course of systemic steriod if severe
   - Subacute dermatitis: Topical steroid cream/ moisturiser
   - Chronic dermatitis: Topical steroid ointment / moisturiser.
3. If the contact dermatitis appears secondarily infected, add an antibiotic eg cloxacillin/erythromycin.
4. lesions typically resolves within 1 - 3 weeks. Prevention is achieved by allergen avoidance (e.g. wearing pants and long-sleeved shirts), and treatmnet includes reduction of post-exposure spread (e.g removing exposed clothing, washing fingernails) and topical / oral corticosteroids.</p>
<h3 id="acute-urticaria">Acute Urticaria<a class="headerlink" href="#acute-urticaria" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>IgE-mediated food allergies (Type I Hypersensitivity) present with rapid onset of urticaria, usually within minutes of exposures. Urticaria are characterized by pruritic, raised, erythematous plaques that arise suddenly and resolve over several hours.</p>
<p>Acute urticaria lasts for &lt;6 wekks while chronic urticaria lasts &gt; 6 weeks. Urticaria is due to mast cell activation in the superficial dermis, which increases release of multiple mediators e.g. histamine that cause pruritus and localized swelling in the upper layers of the skin. Urticaria can be accompanied by angioedema, which is due to mast cell activation in the deeper dermal and subcutaneous tissues (e.g. face, hands, and buttocks).</p>
<p>Clinical feature
- Well-circumscribed, raised erythematous plaques with central pallor
- lesions can be oval, round or serpiginous up to several centimeters in diameter
- Intense pruritus that can persist at night
- Lesions can worse over minutes to hours, then resolve within 24 hours. </p>
<p>Etiologies
- infections (Viral bacterial parasitic)
- IgE mediated (antibiotics, insect bites, latex, food, blood products)
- Direct mast cell activation (narcotics,muscle, relaxers, radiocontrast medium)
- NSAIDs
- Idiopathic (up to 50% of patients)</p>
<h4 id="contact-uticaria">Contact Uticaria<a class="headerlink" href="#contact-uticaria" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>IgE mediated or non-immunologic; 
Allergens
- latex protesin
- Proteinaceous food stuffs
Investigation
- scratch / prick test
  - test site on arms
  - histamine as positive control and saline as negative control</p>
<p>Some substances, on contact with the skin, can evoke, within a very short time, usually minutes, an itchy wheal and flare response. This phenomenon is termed contact urticaria. Unlike allergic contact dermatitis which is a Type IV Hypersensitivity reaction, immunologic contact urticaria is a type I IgE mediated response.</p>
<p>Substances known to cause contact urticaria include:
1. Rubber latex
   - For those allergic to rubber latex, donning of latex gloves results in an itchy reaction, often with wheal formation, within minutes, on the hands.
   - Occasionally, this type I reaction can develop into a full-blown anaphylactic attack. Occupations at risk include medical personnel. Patients, especially those with spine bifida who have had multiple operations and catheterizations, are also at risk of being sensitized to rubber latex, probably because of frequent exposure. They will be at risk of a severe reaction if intubated with a latex endotracheal tube.
   - Note: Patients with contact urticaria to rubber latex can tolerate synthetic rubber.
1. Proteinaceous foods
   - Proteinaceous foods can also cause contact urticaria. Occupations at risk are food handlers. The presentation here is more subtle. Instead of complaining about immediate itch, patients present instead with worsening of pre-existing hand eczema.</p>
<p>Prick Testing</p>
<p>The investigative procedure for detecting contact urticaria is the prick test. The substance, eg a piece of latex glove, is placed on the skin, usually the forearm. The skin is pricked to break the stratum corneum barrier. Histamine is used as a positive control, and saline as a negative control. The test is read at 20 minutes. A positive reading is shown by a wheal and flare response at the test site.</p>
<h4 id="photocontact-dermatitis">Photocontact Dermatitis<a class="headerlink" href="#photocontact-dermatitis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Some substances, on contact with the skin, provoke contact dermatitis only after UV exposure. There are 2 types of photocontact dermatitis:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Photoallergic contact dermatitis</p>
<p>This occurs in a person previously sensitized. Common photocontact allergens include musk ambrette, and sunscreens.</p>
<p>Note: Allergens causing photoallergic contact dermatitis are different from those causing allergic contact dermatitis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phototoxic contact dermatitis</p>
<p>This occurs in all persons in contact with the phototoxic agent and exposed to UV light. Examples of phototoxic agents are psoralens and tar.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Photo-Patch Testing
- This test is essential to confirm a diagnosis of photoallergic contact dermatitis and it should be carried out with a battery of compounds whenever this condition is suspected. The photopatch test differs from the plain patch test in that it requires exposure of the sensitizer to ultraviolet light at some stage of the testing procedure.
- Long wave UV light (UVA) is used for irradiation for this test, because photo allergy is usually produced by radiation with wavelengths over 320 nm.
- Patches put in  2 sets
  - UVA on 1 set
  - Control without UVA on 1 set
- Read at 48 and 96 hours</p>

<p><img alt="epithermis anatomy" src="../figures/skin-epidermis.png" /></p>
<p>Autoimmune blistering diseases are characterized by the presence of autoantibodies directed against structural proteins of the skin. At the basal cell layer of the epidermis, there are proteins which are essential for adhesion of epidermal keratinocytes (eg. desmogleins) and those responsible for epidermal-basement membrane adhesion (eg. BP180/230). These proteins may be affected by autoantibodies, leading to autoimmune blistering diseases. </p>

<h3 id="bullous-pemphigoid">Bullous Pemphigoid<a class="headerlink" href="#bullous-pemphigoid" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This is a chronic, subepidermal AIBD, characterised by <strong>severe itch</strong>. Autoantibodies (IgG/IgM/IgE) specific to the <strong>hemidesmosomal</strong> bullous pemphigoid antigens bind to BP180 and BP230, resulting in cytokine release from T cells, complement activation, neutrophil recruitment, destruction of hemidesmosomes and ultimately, the formation of <strong>subepidermal</strong> blisters.</p>
<ul>
<li>A little more common in Singapore</li>
<li>Quite benign, seen in older people</li>
<li>NO ORAL lesions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clinical Feature</strong>
- The disease is characterized by a variable prodrome of <strong>urticarial plaques</strong> or eczematous patches in the early stages and subsequently develop <strong>large tense bullae and plaques</strong> affecting the <strong>flexural areas, groin, or axilla</strong>.
- It is commonly seen in the elderly, aged 60 years or more. Apart from old age, bullous pemphigoid also occurs commonly in patients with neurological disorders such as strokes, dementia and Parkinson’s disease due to cross-reactivity. </p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
For diagnosis, these investigations are done:
- Skin biopsy for histology
  Subepidermal blister with eosinophils is seen on histology, as the antibodies target hemosdesmosal protein antigens which line the epidermal-dermal junction/ basement membrane zone (BMZ).
- Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF) which is the gold standard
  DIF demonstrates presence of immunoreactants along the BMZ, typically linear C3 and IgG and is positive in 90% of cases. 
- Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF)
  IIF on salt split skin shows a immunoreactivity on the roof of the salt-split skin.
- Serological tests (ELISA, Immunoblot)</p>
<p>Significant morbidity and mortality is associated with active bullous pemphigoid. The most common causes of death include infections, in particular pneumonia, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. </p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>\
The goal of treatment in bullous pemphigoid is to achieve clinical remission with the least treatment-related side effects.</p>

<p>There are <strong>mucosal-dominant</strong> and <strong>mucocutaneous types</strong> of PV. There are IgG autoantibodies directed against <strong>desmoglein 1 (Dsg 1) and desmoglein 3 (Dsg 3)</strong>, leading to keratinocytes separation. In mucosal-dominant type, mainly anti-Dsg3. In mucocutaneous type, both anti-Dsg1 and anti-Dsg2</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
Onset of disease is between 50-60 years old, sometimes even in children. Characterised by erosions and flaccid blisters of the skin and mucous membranes, and separation of the epidermis from the dermis with light friction leaving raw ulcers. A lot of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation arising from healing process of initial injury and insult. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation indicate time has past, early lesions solved.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On histology, there will be an intraepidermal blister with a split at the suprabasal level of the epidermis with inflammatory infiltrates and RBCs. </li>
<li>DIF and IIF show bright <strong>intercellular IgG and C3 deposits within the epidermis</strong>. This is called a fish net appearance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Differentials</strong>
- Like SJS it can cause mucosal lesions and desquamating bullae, however, systemic signs (e.g.fever) are less prominent, and the course is typically more chronic, with oral lesions appearing weeks to months prior to skin symptoms. No post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation unlike pemphigus vulgaris due to the sudden appearance of the lesions.

<p>Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of inherited disorders characterized by epithelial fragility (eg, bullae, erosions, ulcers) triggered by minor trauma.  These conditions are caused by mutations of proteins involved in intraepidermal and dermoepidermal adhesion complexes in the basement membrane zone.</p>
<p>There are four primary subtypes of EB (simplex, junctional, dystrophic, Kindler syndrome), with variable severity within subtypes. EB simplex, is the most common form, which is caused by mutations in keratin genes.  EB simplex presents in children and young adults with friction-induced blisters at the palms and soles and other exposed areas. The lesions typically heal with no residual scarring, although patients may have chronic thickening of the skin of the feet.  Infants with EB simplex may develop oral blisters with bottle-feeding, but mild cases often do not lead to definitive diagnostic testing.</p>

<p>Clinical Features
- starts as an inflammatory papule, pustule, or nodule
- Rapidly progressive, painful ulcer with purulent base and an irregular, violaceous border
- Precipitation of ulceration at site of injury (pathergy)
- PG can present as single or multiple lesions, usually on the trunk or lower extremities. 
- Nearly 30% of cases are triggered by local trauma (pathergy).</p>
<p>Epidemiology

<h3 id="vitiligo">Vitiligo<a class="headerlink" href="#vitiligo" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Acquired depigmentation disorder that occurs due to melanocute destruction. Although vitiligo typically has a more generalized distribution, a subset of patients have lesions that affect only genital or oral mucosa. Patients with vitiligo develop flat, hypopigmented macules with distinct borders, that can expand and coalesce. THese lesions do not have overlying scaling or inflammation, therefore patients are often asymptomatic (e.g. normal vulvar architecture) and the vitiligo may be an incidental finding. Although the etiology of vitiligo is unknown, it is likely partially immune-mediated, as it often occurs in those with concomitant autoimmune disease (e.g. type 1 DM, thyroid disorder). Diagnosis is clinical, and treatment is dependent on disease severity and includes corticosteroids (which can stabilize disease progression) and phototherapy (which may help with repigmentation).</p>
<p>Regional autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, leading to hypopigmentation. It is often associated with other autoimmune disorders, especially chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis and Graves disease.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Feature</strong>
- Depigmented macules on acral areas and extensor surfaces, face commonly affected
- Lesions may be symmetrical, dermatomal, or unilateral</p>
<p><img alt="vitiligo" src="../figures/skin-vitiligo.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Course</strong>
- Most cases progress gradually
- Repigmentation is spontaneous in 10 - 20% of cases
- Increased incidence of other autoimmune disorders (e.g. lupus, thyroid disease, pernicious anemia, Addison disease, alopecia areata, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren Syndrome, primary adrenal insufficiency)</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
- Limited disease: topical corticosteroids
- Extensive/unresponsive disease: oral corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, PUVA
- Due to common co-existence of autoimmune thyroid disease (e.g. Graves or Hashimoto), many experts advise patients with vitiligo be assessed for thyroid function.</p>
<p>Differentials
- Discoid lupus erythematosus can cause areas of depigmentation, however, patients typically have associated well-circumscribed erythematous plaques with an overlying scale and surrounding inflammtion
- Vulvar lichen sclerosus appears as hypopigmented skin with a thin, wrinkled appearance. Patients are often symptomatic with associated pruritus. In addition, lichenification and plaque formation obliterate the vulvar architecture and can cause vaginal introitus stenosis
- Tinea vesicolor can cause hypopigmented, coalescing, scaled macules. These lesions are also usually asymptomatic and preferentially involve the trunk, and upper extremities (rarely the vulva)</p>

- CMNs present within the first few months of life 
- are usually solitary, hyperpigmented lesions with an increased density of overlying dark, coarse hairs
- Initially presenting with flat homogenous hyperpigmentation
- CMNs can grow during infancy and appear as heterogeneously pigmented and raised.</p>
<p><img alt="melanocytic-nevus" src="../figures/skin-congenital-melanocytic-nevus.jpeg" /></p>
<p><strong>Prognosis</strong>
- The risk of transformation to melanoma increases (up to 5%) with increasing size of a CMN</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
- Large lesions are often removed surgically to reduce risk of malignant transformation.<br />
- Small lesions may be removed for cosmetic reasons given their low risk of melanoma transformation.</p>

<p>CDM, previously known as "Mongolian spots") presents as benign, flat, blue-gray patches that are usually found in infants over the lower back and buttocks.  As the name suggests, the macules are caused by the presence of melanocytes within the skin's dermis.  Most infants of African, Asian, and Hispanic ethnicity have CDM at birth.  No treatment is required as the hyperpigmentation usually fades spontaneously during the first decade of life.</p>
<p>CDM should be documented as these patches can be mistaken for bruises, potentially raising concern for coagulopathy or child abuse.</p>

<p>HSP is IgA mediated and is the most common systemic vasculitis of childhood.  </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Feature</strong></p>
<p>The classic tetrad of clinical findings includes:
- Lower extremity palpable purpura
- Lower extremity arthralgia/arthritis
- Abdominal pain/intussusception
- Renal disease
  - Renal manifestations are present in over one third of children with HSP and can develop at symptom onset or months after the initial presentation.<br />
  - Hematuria is the most common finding, followed by mild (non–nephrotic-range) proteinuria.<br />
  - Nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, and elevated creatinine are less common and typically occur more frequently in adults with HSP.  </p>
<p><img alt="henoch-schonlein-purpura" src="../figures/skin-hsp.jpeg" /></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
- A normal platelet count and coagulation studies are required for a diagnosis of HSP, to distinguish it from other cases of gravity dependent purpura of thrombocytopenia.</p>
<p><strong>Prognosis</strong></p>
<p>Children usually make a full recovery with rare cases of end-stage renal failure.</p>
<h3 id="senile-purpura">Senile Purpura<a class="headerlink" href="#senile-purpura" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Aka solar or actinic purpura, is an non-inflammatory disorder, caused by loss of elastic fibers in perivascular connective tissue, that is most common in the elderly but can also be seen in middle-aged patients with extensive sunlight exposure. Minor abrasions that would merely stretch the skin in younger patients can rupture superficial blood vessels in the elderly. The subsequent extravasation of blood leads to ecchymosis over vulnerable areas, such as the dorsum of the hands and forearms. Patients can have residual brownish discoloration from hemosiderin deposition. The incidence and severity are also increased in patients taking anticoagulants, corticosteroids, or NSAIDs.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
- skin fragility
- ecchymosis with normal labs (blood counts and coagulations studies).</p>
<p><img alt="senile-purpura" src="../figures/skin-senile-purpura.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
Senile purpura is usually not a dangerous condition and requires no further investigation. However, many older patients with severe skin fragility may require careful wound care measures following even minor lacerations.</p>

<p>This patient has a superficial infantile hemangioma, also known as a strawberry hemangioma, which is a benign capillary tumor formed from abnormally proliferating endothelial cells. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Feature</strong>
- This vascular birthmark appears during the first few weeks of life as a bright red, sharply demarcated, blanching nodule or plaque.<br />
- The lesion typically undergoes rapid growth during the first year of life followed by spontaneous regression during childhood.</p>
<p><img alt="strawberry" src="../figures/skin-strawberry.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Managment</strong></p>
<p>Although most patients require no intervention, beta blockers (eg, propranolol) are recommended for complicated hemangiomas that are disfiguring, ulcerating, disabling (eg, strabismus from eyelid hemangioma), or life-threatening (eg, tracheal lesions).  Propranolol promotes involution by causing vasoconstriction and by inhibiting growth factors.</p>

<p>Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV) is a disorder characterized histologically by neutrophilic inflammation predominantly limited to the superficial postcapillary venules. By its definition, extracutaneous manifestations are uncommon. Mild myalgia and/or arthralgia are possible, but frank arthritis with joint effusion is more suggestive of systemic disease or connective tissue disease. The most common causes are idiopathic (50%), infections (15-20%), connective tissue disease (15- 20%), drug (10-15%) and neoplasms (2-5%).</p>

<h3 id="acne-vulgaris">Acne Vulgaris<a class="headerlink" href="#acne-vulgaris" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit, - characterized by the formation of comedones, erythematous papules, pustules, as well as occasional cysts and scars. It is characterized by lesion in various stages of development and typically occurs on the face in adolescents. </p>
<p>It usually starts in adolescence and frequently resolves by mid-twenties. It develops earlier in females than in males. The peak incidence is 14-17 years in females and 16-19 years in males.</p>
<p><strong>Pathgenesis</strong></p>
<p>Main pathological changes in acne are:
1. An increase in sebum secretion (presenting as seborrhoea)
2. Pilosebaceous duct hypercornification leading to comedones
3. An increase in Propionibacterium acnes bacteria in the duct
4. Inflammation around the sebaceous gland (probably as a result of the
release of bacterial enzymes and cytokines)</p>
<p>Several factors also contribute to the development of acne
1. Hormones
   - Androgens increase the size of sebaceous glands and the amount of sebum in both male and female adolescents. Oestrogens have the opposite effect. In some women with acne, there is lowering of the concentration of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and a consequent increase in free testosterone concentration. There may also be an increase in androgen sensitivity of the pilosebaceous glands.
   - Acne is also seen in endocrine disorders such as Cushing’s disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and polycystic ovarian syndrome in which there is excessive secretion of hormones (corticosteroids, androgens). These should be investigated in patients with additional suggestive symptoms.
2. Other factors:
   - Acne may be aggravated premenstrually in females due to fluid retention attributed to hormonal changes, leading to increased hydration of and swelling of the duct.
   - The role of diet is controversial and apart from high glycaemic index and dairy product consumption, has not been shown in studies to be an aggravating factor in acne. Genetic factors, however, do play a role in acne.
3. External Factors Causing Acneiform Eruptions
   - <strong>Oils and Tars</strong>. Oils, vegetable oils or mineral oils, can cause “oil folliculitis”, leading to acne-like lesions. Other acnegenic substances include coal tar, dicophane (DDT) and cutting oils. Any site may be affected especially the thighs and lower arms.
   - <strong>Chloracne</strong>. This is caused by exposure to halogenated hydrocarbons (polychlorinated biphenols and related chemicals). Characteristically, there are multiple comedones, inflammatory lesions being infrequent, and these are fairly resistant to therapy. They are commonly found behind the ears, axilla and groin.
   - <strong>Acne cosmetica</strong>. This is a low grade persistent acneiform eruption seen in adult women who have used cosmetics containing comedogenic oils over many years. .
   - <strong>Drugs.</strong> 
     - Corticosteroids, both topical and systemic
     - antiepileptics (in particular, phenytoin)
     - anti-tuberculous drugs (in particular, isoniazid) 
     - lithium.
Some data suggest that refined carbohydrates have an acne-promoting effect, dietary modifications are not effective in treating comedonal acne.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Features of Acne Vulgaris</strong>
- Acne lesions develop from the sebaceous glands associated with hair follicles. Areas involved are the face (99%), back (60%), chest (15%) and anogenital area. Seborrhoea is an almost universal feature. 
- Lesions include:
  - Non-inflamed lesions (comedones)
    - whiteheads (closed comedones)
    - blackheads (open comedones)
  - Inflammatory lesions
    - superficial: 
      - papules
      - pustules
    - deep: 
      - deep pustules
      - nodules/cysts (not true cysts as they have no cyst walls: large fluctuant nodules)
    - scars:
      -  atrophic macules
      -  pits &amp; ice-pick scars
      -  depressed fibrotic scars
      -  keloids and hypertrophic scars (chest, back, jawline)</p>
<p>After the inflammatory lesion resolves, it may also leave behind erythematous macules and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
- Aggravating factor: ingestion of high glycermic index foods</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
- Initial treatment depend on subtype of lesion (see below). 
- Treatment options include
  - Isotretinoin (Roaccutane) - 13-cis Retinoic Acid (0.5-1 mg/kg/day)
    - Acts directly on the pathogenetic factors in acne: decreases sebum production, decreases comedogenesis, decreases inflammation and is also associated with a decrease in p acnes.
    - Main indication: severe acne (nodular) - drug of choice
    - Other indication: moderate acne not controlled on oral antibiotics or frequent relapses on cessation of antibiotic therapy
    - Most serious side effect: teratogenicity (contraindicated in pregnancy; female patients must be on contraception)
    - Other side effects include: 
      - dry mucous membranes and skin 
      - hyperlipidaemia
      - raised liver enzymes 
      - headache
      - benign intracranial hypertension (combination of a tetracycline family member with isotretinoin increases this risk)
      - arthralgia
    - Monitoring
      - Pretreatment: liver function test, fasting lipids (± urine pregnancy test) 
      - During treatment: repeat fasting lipids, liver function test &amp; fasting lipids at least once while on medication (± urine pregnancy test)
  - Hormonal therapy in female patients: oestrogens / anti-androgen. 
    - Eg. Diane-35 (cyproterone acetate and ethinyl oestradiol)
    - Useful if antibiotic therapy fails especially when menstrual regulation or contraception is required as well. Also useful in polycystic ovarian syndrome.
- In all cases, patients with oily skin should be advised to use water- or gel-based cleaners. 
- Inflammatory acne should be treated with oral bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) or doxycycline. But it is often not first line due to the risk of cutaneous ADR. 
- In pregnant woman, use topical benzoyl peroxide.
- Management of acne scars 
  - First Line: Intralesional steroid injections (triamcinolone acetonide 5 or 10 mg/ml): keloids /hypertrophic scars, also useful as an adjunct for nodulocystic acne
  - Surgery: scar excision, subcision
  - CO2 fractional ablative laser: laser resurfacing with 10600 nm
  - Chemical peels: superficial scars</p>
<p><strong>Differentials</strong>
- Rosacea 
  - This is a persistent eruption which occurs on the forehead and cheeks. 
  - It is more common in females and in those aged 30 to 60 . 
  - There is erythema with prominent telangiectasia, pustules and papules.
  - There are no comedones, nodules or cysts and truncal lesions are rare. 
  - It may be associated with blepharitis, conjunctivitis and rhinophyma. 
  - Patients complain of frequent flushing and is usually aggravated by sunlight, hot and spicy food and alcohol.
- Perioral dermatitis. 
  - This is a persistent erythematous eruption composed of tiny papules and papulopustules with a distribution primarily around the mouth and not responsive to topical treatments. 
  - It results from prolonged therapy with powerful (usually fluorinated) topical corticosteroids given for a variety of conditions affecting the “muzzle” area of the face.
- Gram-negative folliculitis. 
  - This may complicate long-term conventional acne treatment. It presents either as a sudden eruption of multiple small follicular pustules or as a development of nodulocystic lesions. 
  - Therapy usually involves stopping the current antibiotics and replacing them with antibiotics to which the organisms are susceptible to (amoxycillin or cotrimoxazole.)
- Malassezia folliculitis. 
  - This is a folliculitis caused by Malassezia furfur. 
  - The lesions are erythematous follicular papules and pustules occurring mainly on the upper trunk and shoulders. 
  - It is usually pruritic.</p>

<p>Monophorphic! </p>
<p>A genetically-determined, chronic, and proliferative autoimmune disease of the skin, characterized by keratinocyte proliferation, inflammation and angiogenesis. In its usual form, it is characterized by the presence of well-defined erythematous plaques surmounted by silvery scales.</p>
<p><strong>Pathology</strong>
Psoriasis is a T lymphocyte-mediated disease, esp Th17.  There is a genetic predisposition, probably multifactorial. Environmental factors are also needed to trigger the disease.</p>
<p>Cornea Stratum turnover rate is accelerate to 4 days as opposed to 28 days. Abnormal corneal site because there is no time to turn around and differentiated properly:
- Thick keratin scale, that forms a poor barrier: silvery scale
- Increased thickness of epidermis
- Polymorphs
- Dilated tortuous blood vessels (Auspitz sign)</p>

<p>Phenotype of psoriasis basically is a spectrum with two ends - the plaque psoriasis and the pustular psoriasis. And think about the </p>
<p><img alt="psoriasis" src="../figures/skin-psoriasis-patho.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Epidemiology</strong>
- The percentage of new psoriatic cases seen in Singapore has been estimated to
be 1.1% of all new dermatology cases seen in the Skin Clinic.
- Prevalence : 1-2% of the general population
- Sex ratio : M =F
- Racial distribution: significantly higher in Indians in Singapore.
- Age of onset: There are 2 peaks, 20-30 years and a smaller peak at 50-60 years. In Singapore, mean age of onset is 34 years.
- Family history: one-third has a positive family. In a patient with psoriasis, the chance of another sibling having psoriasis is 16% if one parent has psoriasis and rises to 50% if 2 parents are affected.</p>
<p><strong>Precipitating Factors</strong>
Before looking at the trigger, definitely check medication compliance first.</p>
<ul>
<li>Local skin trauma (Koebner Phenomenon); isomorphic response, viligo; Need to have moisturizer whether or not the patient is itchy - treating the dry skin is an effective way to </li>
<li>Infections - streptococcal throat infection which tends to provoke guttate
psoriasis</li>
<li>Drugs - lithium, beta-blockers, withdrawal of systemic steroids</li>
<li>The classical teaching is to not give systemic steroids to psoriasis patient</li>
<li>Psoriasis is definitely responsive to steroids</li>
<li>However, it is the withdrawal effect of steroids that is terrible</li>
<li>Rebound psoriasis will recur after withdrawing of steroid, worse than baseline, and might transform to general pustular psoriasis; which is a emergency!</li>
<li>Endocrine – tends to improve during pregnancy and deteriorate after delivery</li>
<li>Certain medications (e.g. antimalarials, indomethacin, propranolol, hydroxychloroquine)</li>
<li>Systemic glucocorticoid withdrawal can precipitate severe erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis</li>
<li>HIV infection - hard to control or worsening psoriasis, always screen for psoriasis.</li>
<li>Pregnancy is a TH2 environment, psoarisis improves; After delivery, psoariasis flares; Psoriasis might manifest in the third trimester, impetigo herpetiformis in the old textbooks now it is called pustular psoriasis of pregnancy. Patients may have fetal distress and require emergency cesarean. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Well-defined, erythematous, hyperkeratotic papules with silvery scale that coalesce to form oval plaques</li>
<li>Pinpoint bleeding following scraping of the scales (Auspitz sign) is a common finding. </li>
<li>Sites: Scalp, hairline, elbows, knees, umbilicus, sacrum.</li>
<li>Symmetrical, well-demarcated, salmon-pink plaques with silvery scales. Removal of scales reveals small bleeding points (Auspitz sign)</li>

Chronic plaque type | Discoid eczema, tinea corporis
Guttate | Pityriasis Rosea, Secondary syphilis
Erythrodermic | Other eczema, drug eruption
Pustular (localized, generalized) | Pyoderma, Herpetic whitlow, Pustular Drug Eruption

<li>The scale is yellow and greasy instead of silver, it is Sehorrhoeic Dermatitis instead of psoriasis of the scalp; Psoriasis tend to extend to the hair line but not sehorrhic dermatitis.</li>
<li>In rare cases, inverse psoriasis or flexorial psoriasis can happen, that deviate from the usual presentation. </li>
<li>Intertrigunous candidiasis presents as plaques and papules in diabetic patients, treat with anti-topical; not inverse psoriasis!</li>
<li>Well defined border means patient has psoriasis not ezcema</li>
<li>Red women or men - generalized erythrodermic psoriasis (described as erythroderma, which is not a diagnosis and is saying that the skin rash is very bad)</li>
<li>Palm flakes and dry looking, with well demarcated border </li>
<li>Pustular psoriasis can affect the toes</li>

<p><strong>Comorbidities</strong>\
Psoriasis may be associated with comorbidities:
1. Psoriatic arthritis
2. Metabolic disorders (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obesity,
metabolic syndrome)
3. Cardiovascular disease
4. Cerebrovascular disease
5. Renal disease e.g. nephrotic syndrome, IgA nephropathy
6. Gout - because of epithermis hyperproliferation, and obesity
7. Non-alcoholic fatty liver
8. Smoking,alcohol abuse
9. Mood disorders e.g. depression - not just reactive, but can be a cerebropsoriatic syndrome.</p>
<p>TNF mediated diseases - common with the above, especially in young patients</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>\
HOLISTIC APPROACH and multi-drug is key to psoriasis.
- consider 6 domains:Peripheral arthritis, Enthesitis, Dactylitis, Axial disease, Skin, Nail
- never skin deep: consider all the comorbidities
- Severity estimation
  - Rule of 10; more than 10% is bad. Burns is rule of 9. 1 palm size is 1 percent.
  - PASI: BSA, degree of erythema, degree of thickness, degree of scaling; research study need to use this, in clinical work this is challenging to get because it is very troublesome.
- Mild topical
- Moderate - Severe: phototherapy</p>

<p>Patient education and counseling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Topical Therapy</p>
</li>
<li>Calcipotriol, a Vit D derivative, inhibits mitosis and induces cell differentiation. Is non-staining and is steroid-sparing agent. Problem of irritation especially if used on the face and flexures. Expensive. Worry about hypercalcemia when used in large area<ul>
<li>In combination with betamethason is currently the FIRST LINE!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>steroids <ul>
<li>Care when used in large areas because of rebound phenomenon, skin atrophy, adrenal suppression, and making psoriasis more unstable. For special sites such as flexures, face – less potent steroids should be used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combine Sterorid wtih Tar e.g. steroid in the day, tar at night<ul>
<li>inhibits mitosis. Problems of staining and smell. Formulations: coal tar cream, shampoo, soap and wash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dithranol (aka anthralin)<ul>
<li>Can go well with elderly but not good in young patient because it is too complicated</li>
<li>Required short contact</li>
<li>Rarely used now</li>
<li>inhibits mitosis. Can cause staining and irritation. Less often used</li>
<li>short contact (30 minutes) anthralin therapy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keratolytic agents - salicyclic acid. For thick scaly plaques and scalp psoriasis.</li>
<li>Pimecrolimnus, tacrolimus are used as well</li>

<li>Need to do it 2 - 3 times a week in the initial stage and then tailored to one week and then stopped</li>
<li>very effective</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Second line, more difficult to use </li>
<li>Soak patient</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Worry about sun burn and skin caner, so this is short term therapy.</p>
<p>Acute side-effects of phototherapy include pruritis, erythema and pigmentation. Chronic side-effects include photoaging, PUVA lentigenes and skin cancers (actinic keratoses, Bowen’s disease, BCC and SCC)</p>
<ol>
<li>Systemic Therapy</li>
<li>Methotrexate: <ul>
<li>inhibit DNA synthesis, weekly dose 2.5 - 25 mg/week, </li>
<li>given with folic acid to reduce liver toxicity and GI side effects of MTX</li>
<li>LFT, FBC regularly</li>
<li>First line for skin and joint, as well as pustular</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acitretin<ul>
<li>An retinoid, brother of isoretinol</li>
<li>Good for pustular types: GPP, ACH, palmoplantar pustulosis</li>
<li>Extensive</li>
<li>Mucocutaneous effect (e.g. on lips) limit effect</li>

Unlike cutaneous LP (eg, pruritic purple/pink polygonal papules), oral LP lesions are most commonly characterized by <strong>white papules</strong> or plaques connected by white, lacy markings known as <strong>Wickham striae</strong>; erythematous mucosal atrophy or ulcerations can also occur. Lesions are typically bilateral and symmetric and can form along the lines of minor trauma <strong>(Köbner phenomenon)</strong>. Oral LP is often asymptomatic but can be associated with pain or irritation.</p>
<p>Mucous membrane – especially buccal mucosa, tongue and lips. </p>
<p>May become erosive and painful. Patients can complain of burning mouth, cannot eat spicy food; related to dental almougum allergic contact dermitisi of buccal mucosa; might need patch to test. Rarely, carcinoma may develop.</p>
<p><img alt="lichen planus oral" src="../figures/skin-lichen-planus-wickham.jpg" /></p>
<p>The diagnosis of LP is based primarily on examination, but biopsy should be considered for confirmation, especially in patients with erythematous mucosal atrophy or ulceration. Treatment includes <strong>topical high-potency glucocorticoids</strong> (eg, fluocinonide). Unlike cutaneous LP, which is self-limited and often resolves within 2 years, oral LP often has a prolonged course with relapsing symptoms over many years.</p>

<p>Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is a blistering skin condition most commonly found in infants and young children.  The pathogenesis involves infection with certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus that produce exfoliative toxins, which disrupt keratinocyte adhesion in the superficial epidermis. In neonates, the source of infection is often the umbilicus or circumcision site, whereas in older children, there may be nasopharyngeal colonization or a primary skin lesion (eg, pustule).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Feature</strong> 
- Usually seen in children age &lt; 6. 
- Begins with a prodrome of fever, irritability, and skin tenderness.<br />
- Generalized erythema is then followed by flaccid blisters/bullae located predominantly in flexural areas exposed to mechanical pressure (eg, axillae, groin).<br />
- Although perioral crusting can occur, mucosal surfaces are typically spared.<br />
- Gentle pressure on the skin surface causes detachment of a superficial layer of skin (ie, Nikolsky sign), and epidermal shedding exposes underlying erythematous skin with a scalded appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
Clinical</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
- supportive wound care for denuded areas
- antistaphylococcal antibiotics (eg, nafcillin, vancomycin)</p>
<p><strong>Prognosis</strong>
- mortality rate is low in children, and symptoms typically resolve in 1-2 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Clinical Feature</strong>
- It is characterized by pruritic, honey-colored macules, vesciles, and bullae on the face or other exposed parts. 
- The skin becomes a tense, clear blister. There are little or no symptoms. Flaccid blisters filled with purulent exudates.
- Usually non-symmetric lesions.
- Usually located in areas with skin folds like the armpit, groin, between the fingers or toes, beneath the breast, and between the buttocks.
- This is common in children</p>

<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
- Presents in infants and young children with bright, sharply demarcated, confluent erythema in the perianal or perineal region.<br />
- Associated features include perianal pruritus and pain, particularly with stooling.<br />
- In some patients, perirectal fissures and blood-streaked stools may occur.<br />
- Due to pain while stooling, patients may also have constipation from withholding.<br />
- Although patients often do not have concomitant streptococcal pharyngitis, there may be a close contact with recent streptococcal infection (eg, cellulitis, pharyngitis).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
This condition can be suspected based on clinical features alone, and the diagnosis can be confirmed with a perianal bacterial culture.  </p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
Treatment is with oral beta-lactam antibiotics (eg, penicillin, amoxicillin).</p>
<p>(Choice A)  Candidal diaper dermatitis presents with significant erythema but its distribution is usually more widespread, including satellite lesions or lesions in skinfolds.  In addition, this patient's lack of response to antifungal creams makes candidal infection less likely.</p>
<p>(Choice B)  Irritant diaper dermatitis presents with erythema and skin breakdown in the diaper area due to prolonged exposure to urine or stool in the diaper, particularly in the setting of diarrhea.  This patient's lack of response to barrier ointments and use of diapers only at night make irritant diaper dermatitis less likely.</p>
<p>(Choice C)  Pinworm infection is caused by Enterobius vermicularis and presents with perianal pruritus (pruritus ani), classically at night.

<h4 id="cutaneous-tuberculosis">Cutaneous Tuberculosis<a class="headerlink" href="#cutaneous-tuberculosis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The disease may be due to direct innoculation, spread from an endogenous focus, or an immunological response to the TB bacilli.
1) Lupus vulgaris: TB bacilli can be found in the granuloma. Lesions are
usually well-defined reddish-brown nodules typically found on the face or hand. There is a typical ‘Apple-jelly’ appearance on diascopy and lesions may persist for years, leading to subsequent scarring and disfigurement. It is very rare these days.
2) Tuberculosis verrucosa cutis: The most common cutaneous TB seen in Singapore. Typically presents as a verrucous, hyperkeratotic mass on the exposed parts of the body. Occurs after direct inoculation of TB into the skin.
3) Scrofuloderma: Direct extension of underlying TB infection from a deep structure like lymph nodes, bone, etc. Often seen as a discharging sinus.
4) Orificial TB: Occurs around the mouth, nose or perinanal region as a result of extension of infection from the GIT.
5) Erythema Induratum (Bazin’s Disease): Painful, subcutaneous masses on the calves. Strongly positive Mantoux test. Responds to TB treatment.
6) Erythema nodosum: Painful evanescent nodules on the shin which can be due to many other causes like drugs and fungal infection.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Identification of AFB from tissue sections or a positive culture for M. tuberculosis is definite proof of infection. However, in practice, evidence of TB infection in the lung or elsewhere, and a strongly positive Mantoux test is sufficient to make a diagnosis</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Patients with cutaneous TB need to be treated with antituberculous drugs as for extrapulmonary TB. This usually involves a combination of antibiotics (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) given over a period of several months and sometimes years.</p>
<h4 id="atypical-mycobacteria-infection-02">ATYPICAL MYCOBACTERIA INFECTION 02<a class="headerlink" href="#atypical-mycobacteria-infection-02" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A number of mycobacteria which are normally resident in soil and water can infect humans when inoculated into the skin during injury. The common species are M. marinum and M. avium-intracellulare. They cause a granuloma or ulcer on the exposed part, usually the hand. They are called ‘Fish-tank granuloma’ because they are more common among aquarium hobbyists who acquire the disease from injuries sustained during the cleaning of fish-tanks.</p>
<h4 id="leprosy">LEPROSY<a class="headerlink" href="#leprosy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Microbiology: Caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Humans are the major host and reservoir of M. leprae and armadillos are the only natural environmental reservoir of M. leprae. In the laboratory, it can infect nude mice and Mankeby monkeys.
Transmission of leprosy:
Leprosy bacilli are only found in human beings and Armadillos. It is transmitted by droplet spread. Multibacillary patients with nasal involvement are the highest risk. Close contacts and fomites are not thought to be important. Only about 5-10% of the whole population is naturally able to develop Leprosy following exposure.
Pathology: The bacilli grow in the skin and nerves, and rarely, the mucous membrane and testis. They produce granulomata which destroy the nerve and skin, leading to nerve damage and permanent disfigurement and disablement. The dead bacilli in the body act as antigens and cause an immunological phenomenon called “Type 1 and 2 reactions”, which can result in rapid damage to nerve and skin.</p>
<p>The damaged nerve results in:
1. sensory loss – leading to repeated trauma, unconscious injuries and consequent loss of limbs.
2. motor loss - resulting in permanent joint deformities. 
3. neuropathic loss - resulting in resorption of bone and loss of digits</p>
<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Patients with leprosy may present with Type 1 or 2 reactions as the first presentation. While leprosy granulomata are usually asymptomatic and gradual in onset, a Reaction is a very acute episode with redness, swelling and pain. Nerve deficit can be sudden with paralysis.
- Type 1 or Leprae Reaction is due to a change in the immune status at the site of the lesion (both skin and nerve). Previously subclinical sites can become obvious, giving the impression that a new site is involved. The nerve becomes painful, tender and paralysed.
- Type 2 or Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) Reaction is due to an immune- complex mediated process. It occurs following treatment during which the bacilli is killed, but also occurs without prior treatment. The dead bacilli, acting as antigen, results in excessive circulating antibodies which lead to the formation of immune- complexes. These are trapped by the capillaries, and depending on where it is, produces the following:
  - Erythema nodosum leprosum in the skin
  - Neuritis in the nerve
  - Nephritis, hepatitis, leucocytosis, raised ESR etc.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>
Skin lesion is the presenting disease in 95% of cases and nerve damage in the remaining 5%.</p>
<p>The skin lesion of leprosy has a very varied morphology. It may be hypopigmented, skin coloured, or red. It may appear dry, or markedly swollen. The characteristic feature is that of anaesthesia due to damage to nerve fibres around it. It is neither itchy nor painful. Based on the type of skin lesions, leprosy is classified according to RIDLEY AND JOPLING’S CLASSIFICATION:
1) Indeterminate Leprosy
2) Tuberculoid Leprosy (TT)
3) Borderline Tuberculoid Leprosy (BT)
4) Borderline Borderline Leprosy (BB)
5) Borderline Lepromatous Leprosy (BL)
6) Lepromatous Leprosy (LL)</p>
<p>The cardinal features of Leprosy are:
- Skin lesion that is anaesthetic on pin-prick.
- Skin lesion with concomitant nerve lesion (ie thickened nerve, sensory loss, motor deficit, autonomic function loss - loss of sweating, loss of hair, negative histamine flare and negative Mecholol test for sweating).
- Skin lesion with Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) demonstrated on slit skin smear.
- Skin lesion with histological features consistent with leprosy on biopsy.</p>
<p>Nerve trunk lesions may present as:
- Loss of sensation noticed by patients, or on testing by doctors.
- Injuries on the body (usually hands and feet) which may be unnoticed by patients. Often present as ulcers or blisters.
- Thickened nerve. The superficial nerves near the body surface are most vulnerable. They are Greater Auricular Nerve, Facial Nerve, Ulnar Nerve, Median Nerve, Radial Nerve and Posterior Tibial Nerve.
- Muscle weakness and wasting.</p>
<p><strong>Laboratory Diagnosis</strong>
1) Slit Skin Smear: Test used to demonstrate the AFB bacilli from the skin lesion and to quantify them. The tissue fluid is collected by a tiny slit of the skin with a scalpel blade and smeared on a microscopic slide and dried. It is then stained with Carbofuschin, decolorised with alcohol, and counterstained with Methylene blue. The bacilli appear as red rods or clumps. They are reported by the indices BACTERIAL INDEX (BI) and MORPHOLOGICAL INDEX (MI). BI= 0 1+ 2+ 3+ 4+ 5+or 6+
MI = %.
2) Histological Examination.
3) Serological Tests using Synthetic antigen (NBO-BSA) is not useful
4) Lepromin test: M. leprae antigen grown in armadillo is injected intradermally
and a reading is performed after 21 days. The size of the induration is recorded in mm. This provides a measure of a person’s immunity towards leprosy but cannot be used for diagnosis.
5) Culture of bacilli in Mouse foot pad and Armadillo can be used for drug sensitivity testing.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>
First-line standard treatment as per WHO Recommendation for Multi-drug therapy (MDT).
 Type | Adult | Children (10-14 years old)
|---|---|---
Multibacillary leprosy | Rifampicin: 600 mg once a month <br> Dapsone: 100 mg daily  <br> Clofazimine: 300 mg once a month, and 50 mg daily <br> <br> Duration= 12 months*| Rifampicin: 450 mg once a month <br> Dapsone: 50 mg daily  <br> Clofazimine: 150 mg once a month, and 50 mg every other day <br> <br>Duration= 12 months*|
|Paucibacillary leprosy|Rifampicin: 600 mg once a month<br>Dapsone: 100 mg daily<br><br> Duration= 6 months**| Rifampicin: 450 mg once a month <br> Dapsone: 50 mg daily <br> <br> Duration= 6 months**</p>
<p>At National Skin Center in Singapore, treatment durations are longer than that recommended by WHO.
- For multibacillary leprosy, treatment duration is for a minimum of 12 months and may be prolonged to 24 months if the patient is clinically and bacteriologically not cleared, or when bacillary index is ≥4+.
- For paucibacillary leprosy, treatment duration is for a minimum of 6 months and may be prolonged if the patient is clinically and bacteriologically not cleared.</p>
<p>Type I Reaction: Prednisolone, or Cyclosporin
Type 2 Reaction: Prednisolone, Clofazamine 300 mg daily (in combination with prednisolone), or Thalidomide</p>
<p>Complications of Leprosy from permanent nerve damage:
1) Blindness: From anaesthesia of the eye and repeated injuries
2) Loss of fingers: From muscle weakness, repeated trauma and neuropathic changes.
3) Neuropathic ulcer on the sole: From anaesthesia, repeated trauma, and muscle weakness.
4) Below-knee amputation: From chronic ulcers, neuropathic joints, infection, septicaemia, and squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>Control of Leprosy is a public health problem
Vaccination: No useful vaccine is available
The main strategy is the identification and successful treatment of all human cases so as to eradicate the pool of infection.</p>
<h3 id="fungi-diseases">Fungi Diseases<a class="headerlink" href="#fungi-diseases" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Fungal disease of the skin may involve the keratin layer of skin, nail or hair and are termed SUPERFICIAL MYCOSES. When it involves the subcutis it is termed DEEP OR SUBCUTANEOUS MYCOSES.</p>
<p>The common fungi are 
1. Malassezia furfur</p>
<ul>
<li>Malassezia furfur only grow on the keratin layer to produce Tinea Versicolor (or Pityriasis Versicolor).</li>
<li>Dermatophytes </li>
</ul>
<p>Dermatophyte is a general name for fungi of three genera, namely Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton. They cause disease of the skin, nail and hair. The disease is referred to as “Tinea” followed by a term denoting the anatomical site e.g. Tinea Corporis = body infection.
     - The most common species found in Singapore are: 
       - Trichophyton rubrum
       - Trichophyton mentagrophytes
       - Epidermophyton flocossum 
       - Microsporum canis
     - Clinical feature summary
       -  Tinea corporis: Smooth skin of body: topical or oral
       -  T cruris: Groin, scrotum and buttock: topical or oral
       -  T pedis: Toe web and sole: oral
       -  T mannum: Palm: oral
       -  T unguium: Nail plate and surrounding skin: oral
       -  T capitis: Scalp hair and skin: oral
3. Candidal yeasts. </p>
<ul>
<li>Candidal yeasts affect the mucous membrane and nail and have a predilection for the wet part of the skin like toe webs, groin and axillae.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fusarium, Culvararia, Aspergillus and Scytallidium are the other less common fungi involved.</p>
<h4 id="malassezia-folliculitis">Malassezia Folliculitis<a class="headerlink" href="#malassezia-folliculitis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Previously known as pityrosporum folliculitis, it is an infection of hair follicles caused by lipophilic malassezia yeasts. There are multiple malassezia species, including furfur, globosa, sympodialis and restricta. The yeast is a normal inhabitant of human skin and only causes disease under specific conditions</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Feature</strong>
- Common complication of acne. 
- <strong>Monomorphic</strong> appearing lesions.</p>

<h4 id="pityriasis-versicolor-tinea-versicolor">Pityriasis Versicolor (Tinea Versicolor)<a class="headerlink" href="#pityriasis-versicolor-tinea-versicolor" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Fungus: M. furfur is part of the normal flora in 70% of individuals. Only some develop disease. Predisposing factors include: genetics, heat, sweat, poor hygiene and immunocompromised states.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation</strong>
- Patient noticed multiple hypopigmented spotsafter sun exposure, when the surrounding skin becomes more darkly pigmented than the affected area. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>
- Hypopigmented (pale) or Pigmented (black or brown) skin lesions
- Pink lesions with a sharply demarcated edge 
- May have fine, powdery scales
- May have pruritus
- Extent and shape of lesions vary greatly.
- Location
  - Typically in the trunk and upper extremity
  - Facial involvement in children</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
- ‘Spaghetti and Meatball’ on 30% Potassium hydroxide mount. Culture is not done.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>
- Topical: Selenium sulphide, sodium thiosulphate, imidazoles, allyllamines, amorolfine, propylene glycol.
- Oral: Ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole.</p>
<p><strong>Differentials</strong>
-   Mycosis fungoides, a hypopigmented rash that typically appears on the trunk, may be an initial presentation of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.  Severe pruritus is common.  The presentation is less acute, and lesions relapse and remit over time regardless of season or sun exposure.
-   Vitiligo presents as hypopigmented areas of skin that commonly involve the face but may be seen on any part of the body.  The lesions are asymptomatic and do not present with scaling or itching.</p>
<h4 id="tinea-corporis">Tinea Corporis<a class="headerlink" href="#tinea-corporis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Cutaneous dermatophyte infection, most commonly caused by Trichohyton rubrum. The fungi thrive in warm moist areas. 
Clinical feature: Circumscribed lesion with a sharp edge which is more raised and scaly than the centre. May be red and inflamed or skin-coloured depending on the species responsible. Follicular prominence may be seen. It grows slowly and may be itchy. Diagnosis is confirmed by scrape for fungus and culture.</p>
<p><strong>Risk factor</strong>
- Athletes who have skin-to-skin contact
- Humid environment
- Contact with infected animals (e.g. rodents, kittens) or formites</p>
<p><strong>Presentation</strong>
- Pruirit plaque with a raised scaly border
- Scaly, erythematous, pruritic patch with centrifugal spread

- Can be confirmed with potassium hydroxide examination of skin scraping in severe, atypical, or refractory cases. </p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>
- First-line / localized: topical antifungals (e.g. clotrimazole, terbinafine)
- Second-line / extensive: oral antifungals (e.g. terbinafine, griseofulvin)</p>
<p><strong>Differentials</strong>
- Erythema migrans are occasionally pruritic but are not scaly and typically do not have a raised border; Patients frequently have systematic symptoms such as myalgia / fatigue, and a history of exposure to ticks in an endemic area
- Psoriasis presents with scaly plaques but typically occurs symmetrically on the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees. Itching may be present but is usually mild. Psoriasis may occur in adolescents but is more common at age &gt;30.
- Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus can cause annular plaques but typically presents with numerous lesions, predominantly in sun-exposed areas of the upper body. Itching is common
- Urticaria presents acutely (minutes to hours) as well-circumscribed, erythematous plaques with intense pruritus and associated edema (i.e. wheals). The lesions do not develop scale and typically resolve within 24 hours.</p>
<h4 id="tinea-cruris">Tinea Cruris<a class="headerlink" href="#tinea-cruris" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Clinical features: Lesion similar to T corporis but affects the groin. Usually starts on one side and subsequently affects the contralateral side. It is the most common dermatophyte infection in Singapore.</p>
<h4 id="tinea-pedis">Tinea Pedis<a class="headerlink" href="#tinea-pedis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>This is a ubiquitous dermatophyte infection and the most common of the superficial fungal infections. Most commonly due to Trichophyton rubrum and similar species</p>
<p><strong>Risk factors</strong>
- Barefoot walking in public areas (e.g. swimming pools, athletic facilities)
- Local friction and warmth between the toes, in combination with the patient's wearing and frequency of changing of socks and shoes as well as wearing of wet shoes for a prolonged period of time, and the accumulation of moisture in his feet, particularly between the toes represent common contributory factors.
- Other factors could be diabetes, immune compromising states such as chronic steroid therapy, and chemotherapy. HIV/AIDS can also lead to tinea pedis and onycomycosis.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>
-  May be one of 4 types. 
    Type | Feature
    |---|---
    Intertriginous type | - Wet soggy toe-web, usually begins with the 4<sup>th</sup> web. <br> - pruritus, erythema, erosion between toes <br>- May be odorous. <br> - Also called Athlete’s Foot.
    Keratotic type | - Skin of sole becomes dry and scaly. <br> - May extend form toe-web to forefoot.
    Vesiculo-bullous type| - Non-itchy, irregular, vesicles which may be multi-loculated and sometimes pustular.<br> -painful bullae, erythema (lateral midfoot)
    Moccassin type | -scales/fissures <br> -extension onto the soles, side or dorsum of foot <br> - Entire skin of sole is uniformly thickened and smooth
- Clinical progression
  - Disease is often one-sided initially.
  - Progession is very very slow
  - Acute: pruritus, burning pain, erythematous vesicles/bullae
  - Chronic: pruritus, erythema, interdigital scales/fissures/erosions with extension onto the sole, side, or dorsum of the foot
- Complications: 
  - secondary infection
  - recurrence</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
The diagnosis is often made clinically but can also be aided with microscopy, where scrapings from the affected area are examined under microscopy, after treatment with potassium hydroxide. KOH preparation of skin scrapings show branches segmented hyhae. </p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
- Keep feet dry and dispose of old footwear
- First line: Topical antifungal medications (miconazole, tolnaftate)
    -   A wide variety of topical agents are available, in cream, gel, lotion, and shampoo formulations. A majority of the agents are of the 'azole' antifungal family (clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole, coiconazole, ticonazole, etc.).
    -   Terbinafine and naftifine represent the 'allylamine' family of agents. Both families of drugs are known for their high efficacy against the dermatophytes.
    -   Tolnaftate can also be used
    -   Nystatin (primarily used for Candida infections) is not effective against dermatophytes.
- Second line: oral antifungals (e.g. fluconazole)</p>
<h4 id="tinea-mannus">Tinea Mannus<a class="headerlink" href="#tinea-mannus" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>

The same organisms can affect the interdigital spaces of the toes, leading to tinea pedis; manifestations include itching, erythema (as in this patient), and scaling.</p>
<p><strong>Risk factors</strong>
- Advanced Age
- Tinea pedis
- Diabetes
- Peripheral Vascular Disease</p>
<p><strong>Clinical feature</strong>
- Very slow and progressive
- Typically painless but the thickening and roughness of the nails may cause problems with stockings and footwear. 
-  In addition, fissuring of the surrounding skin may allow the entry of bacteria, leading to paronychia.<br />
- Thick, brittle, discolored nails
- Nail plate may be involved to a varying degree to produce various types:
  Types | Feature
  |--- |---
  White Superficial Onycomycosis (WSO)| Only top layer of nail plate.
  Lateral Subungal Onychomycosis (LSO)| The lateral edge of nail plate is raised and appears white or yellow.
  Proximal Subungal Onychomycosis (PSO) |
  Distal Subungal Onychomycosis (DSO) |
  Total Nail Dystrophy (TND)| The nail plate becomes friable and breaks off.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
- KOH
- Periodic acid-Schiff stain, culture</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>
- First line: terbinafine, itraconazole

<h4 id="sporotrichosis">Sporotrichosis<a class="headerlink" href="#sporotrichosis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Fungus: Sporothrix schenckii. Found in soil and thorns of plants. Very rare in Singapore, but common in Africa and South America. This is a fungal infection acquired by direct traumatic inoculation of the skin, typically from rose bushes or other plant materials. It is characterized by ulcerating, pustular nodules at the site of inoculation and associated lymphatic channels. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Feature</strong>
- The fungus enters though a puncture wound and grows gradually into a painless, firm nodule. 
- It presents as a small papule or nodule at the inoculation site, usually on exposed skin of the hand or arm which then may enlarge, ulcerate, and lead to additional lesions along the draining lymphatics. 
- It may ulcerate and present as an ulcer. 
- Lymphatic spread produces a chain of nodules and ulcers. 
- Pain, if present, is mild.

<h4 id="herpes-simplex">Herpes Simplex<a class="headerlink" href="#herpes-simplex" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Herpes simplex type 1 and 2. Often transmitted through close and sexual contact through mucous membrane and broken skin. Following infection, the virus lies dormant in the dorsal root ganglion and travels periodically to the skin or mucous membrane to cause recurrence of clinical disease. Shedding of virus may occur without obvious clinical disease.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical diseases:</strong>
1) <strong>Primary Gingivostomatitis</strong>: A
   - Affects children of age 1 to 5 years old. 
   - Mouth becomes ulcerated and may be associated with fever and refusal to feed. 
   - Up to 75% of individuals can have this disease by 18 years old.
1) <strong>Recurrent herpes labialis</strong>: 
   - Also called Cold-sores. 
   - Clear vesicles and ulcers occur at the same site during each recurrence and is preceded by a tingling or numb sensation. 
   - Lesions heal within a week without scarring. 
   - Can be precipitated by stress, menstruation, etc.
1) <strong>Primary attack genital herpes and recurrent genital herpes</strong>: 
   - Usually sexually transmitted (But may be by other contact). 
   - Affects both the female and male genital tracts. 
2) <strong>Disseminated herpes</strong>: 
   - Most commonly in newborns but also in adults. 
   - Lesions are seen on all parts of the body
3) <strong>Inoculation herpes</strong>: 
   - Most commonly over the finger pulp following traumatic inoculation. 
   - It is extremely painful and is called ”Whitlow”
4) <strong>Eczema herpeticum</strong>: 
   - Patients with eczema of any cause can have a superimposed herpes simplex infection.
   - Painful, vesicular rash with "punched out" erosions, and hemorrhagic crusting 
   - <em>Kaposi’s varicelliform eruption</em> refers to a generalised, and sometimes systemic herpetic infection in a patient with eczema which can be fatal.</p>
<p>Eczema herpeticum is a potential complication of severe atopic dermatitis.  Superinfection with herpes simplex virus can cause a vesicular eruption on preexisting inflamed skin.  These patients often have fever and pain.</p>
<p><img alt="herpeticum" src="../figures/skin-Eczema_herpitcum.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong>
1) Tzanck smear: Skin cells at the base of vesicle or ulcer becomes enlarged
and vacuolated. On staining with Giemsa stain, it appears as “Giant Cells”. Tzanck smear is positive in many other vesicles due to virus e.g. Chickenpox. It is not specific for Herpes simplex infection.
2) Staining with monoclonal antibody (Immunofluorescence).
3) Cultures on fertilised egg: Cytopathic effect is seen.
4) Antibody to herpes simplex is not useful. It shows only past infection and
does not differentiate the type of disease. Antibodies can be found in &frac34; of normal individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>
- Topical Antiviral: Acyclovir cream, Idoxuridine cream.
- Oral Antiviral: Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, Famciclovir. 
- Drug is given within 72 hours for maximal benefit.

When the hard layer is removed, tiny bleeding spots (capillaries) may be seen. <img alt="commonwart" src="../figures/skin-common-warts.jpg" />
Plane warts | Small, smooth surface, often seen on face, neck and forearm. May undergo koebnerization (appearance of skin lesion at site of trauma). <img alt="planewarts" src="../figures/skin-plane-warts.jpg" />
Plantar warts | Grows deep into the skin and appear flush with the skin with overlying callosity. May be single, or multiple. ”Mosaic warts’ are numerous and occur most commonly on the heel.<img alt="plantarwarts" src="../figures/skin-plantar_warts.jpg" />
Filiform warts| Appear as finger-like projections, found mainly on the face. <img alt="filiformwarts" src="../figures/skin-filiform-warts.jpg" />
Periungal (and subungal) warts | Under the nail plate or on periungal skin with extension under the nail plate. <br> <img alt="periungalwart" src="../figures/skin-periungal-wart.jpg" />
Genital warts (Condylomata acuminata) | Soft, sessile and fast-growing tumour in the glans, prepuce, vulva, vaginal wall and cervix. Some HPV types may be premalignant. A rare, giant wart is referred to as “Buschke- Lowenstein tumour”. <img alt="genitalwart" src="../figures/skin-genitalwart.jpg" />
Epidermodysplasia verruciformi | Also known as treeman syndrome, is an extremely rare autosomal recessive hereditary skin disorder associated with a high risk of skin cancer. It is characterized by abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) of the skin. Patients have a large number of warts on the body, ranging from small plane warts, to large plaques. There is a genetic problem and malignant changes occur in 20% of cases. <img alt="epidermodysplasia" src="../figures/skin-epidermodysplasia-verruciformi.jpg" />
Generalised warts | Multiple large warts on the body. May be associated with abnormal immune status e.g. Hodgkin’s disease.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Based on typical clinical features and histological examination if in doubt. DNA hybridisation of tissue is an expensive and hard to obtain technique.</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
- Treatment
  1) Spontaneous remission occurs in 40% within 2 years.
  2) Topical: 
     - Salicylic acid, lactic acid
     - Podophyllin and Podophyllotoxin paint for genital warts
     - imiquimod, 5-florouracil
  3) Cryotherapy: 
     - Using Liquid nitrogen. Repeated treatment is needed.  (T = - 196 C)
     - Dimethylether and propane e.g. wartner, histofreeze (T = - 57 C)
  4) Surgical techniques using electrosurgery, laser surgery or surgical excision under anaesthesia.
  5) Oral cimetidine appears to work in children.
  6) Oral diphencyprone
  7) Bleomycin injection
  8) Immunotherapy by various methods to change the immune response.
- Health Risk management
  - HPV is also associated with increased risk for other sexually transmitted diseases, especially HIV.  HIV screening should be offered to patients with a new diagnosis of HPV.<br />
  - Biopsy may be considered in atypical cases.  HPV infection (especially serotypes 16 and 18) is associated with increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma of the anus, genital organs, and throat. </p>
<h4 id="molluscum-contagiosum">Molluscum Contagiosum<a class="headerlink" href="#molluscum-contagiosum" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A self-limited poxvirus infection transmitted via skin-to-skin contact by close contact (including sexual) and autoinnoculation or by fomites. Species of Pox virus. Transmitted by close contact (including sexual) and autoinnoculation.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Feature</strong> 
- Characterized by small skin-colored, pruritic papules that may occur anywhere except the palms and soles.
- When mature, it becomes pearly and develops a central pit in which an amorphous, cheesy material (Molluscum body) can be found. 
- The Molluscum body drops to result in umbilication.
- In children with atopic dermatitis, immunocompromised children, and HIV patients, the condition may be more widely disseminated and persistent in these patients (especially if CD4 cell count &lt;100/mm3),  very extensive disease may be seen. </p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
- Spontaneous remission seen within 9 months in many cases.
- Destruction with application of Trichloroacetic acid or liquid nitrogen can be used.</p>
<p>It is also frequently seen in patients with HIV and may be more widely disseminated and persistent in these patients (especially if CD4 cell count &lt;100/mm3). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Feature</strong>
- Small skin-colored papules with umbilicated centers
- lesions may be widely scattered or grouped due to autoinoculation from nearby skin.
- may be accompanied by pruritus and local dermatitis and may cause conjunctivitis if the lid margin is involved.</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong>
- In children, lesions commonly appear on the extremities, face, or trunk; in adults sexual transmission may lead to elsions on the lower trunk and anogenital regions. 
- Spares palms and soles</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Primarily clinical based on appearance of the lesion</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
- MC is self-limited with resolution within 6 - 12 months

<h4 id="scabies">Scabies<a class="headerlink" href="#scabies" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Scabies is caused by <em>Sarcoptes scabiei</em> infestation, a mite that infects only humans. Transmitted by close contacts, with an incubation period of 3-6 weeks. Female mite burrows into the skin to lay eggs.  Classically, scabies is an intensely pruritic rash characterized by small erythematous papules in a linear arrangement (burrows) favor the <strong>web spaces, wrists and ankles, genitals, nipples, and waistline</strong>. <strong>This the wet damp area.</strong> First-line treatment is topical 5% permethrin or oral ivermectin.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Course</strong>
Immune response to mite, eggs and faecal material produce the itch, redness and swelling. Secondary bacterial infection causing pus-filled lesions invariably occurs. The skin lesion may also undergo secondary eczematisation. Immune reaction maybe localised and persistent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Infants tend to have scabies around the whole head</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>
The itch is typically more severe at night (nocturnal exacerbation). Other family members with itch or similar disease simultaneously or shortly before is a useful clinical pointer.</p>
<p>1) Classical scabies: </p>
<ul>
<li>The rash consists of small, erythematous papules or vesicles </li>
<li>Pathognomonic burrows, or &lt;1-cm lines on the skin, caused by the female mite burrowing into the epidermis to lay eggs. Burrow may be found on close examination, or the burrow may be revealed by painting with a marker pen and washed off. Burrows may not be visible or may be difficult to visualize due to excoriation.</li>
</ul>
<p>2) Scabies with secondary bacterial infection: </p>
<ul>
<li>Most common type of disease seen. </li>
<li>Most common in children and young adults. </li>
<li>Infants can get scabies from care-givers, and tend to have pustular lesions by the time they present.</li>
</ul>
<p>3) Scabetic nodules: An extremely itchy nodule on the scrotum, vulva, and axillae. </p>
<ul>
<li>The mite is extremely difficult to find in these patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>4) Scabies incognito: </p>
<ul>
<li>A persistent itchy patch that do not spread or extent may be produced. </li>
<li>Occurs in individuals with good personal hygiene.</li>
</ul>
<p>5) Norwegian or crusted scabies: </p>
<ul>
<li>Often occurs in old patients or in individuals with poor general condition. </li>
<li>The whole body, especially the back of the ear, dorsum of elbow, knee, sacral regions, and nail bed are thickened with crusts. </li>
<li>Millions of mites are present, but the patient does NOT itch.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Diagnosis is usually clinical but may be confirmed by identify mites, part of its body, eggs and faecal material on scraping of the crust and from debris under the nail.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>
<p>Scabies must be treated to prevent severe disease and spread to others. 
- Break the chain of infection: treat household contacts and decontaminating linens (eg, hot water washing of clothing and bedding).
- Antibiotics are important because secondary bacterial infection is common. 
- Symptomatic treatment for itch and secondary eczema. 
- Anti-scabetics include:
  - First line: 
    - topical <strong>5% permethrin</strong> (kills both mites and eggs) 
    - or oral ivermectin: new drug! important because it is easier to use than topicals and hence more effectives; currently reserved for treatment of recalcitrant scabies and Norwegian scabies.
  - Others
    - Benzyl benzoate 10% or 25%
    - Topical Malathion 1% - negligible rate of systemic absorption, one of preferred 1<sup>st</sup> line.
    - Crotamiton cream
    - Lindane (Gamma-benzene hexachloride)
    - Monosulfiram / 4% sulphure cream - requires multiple application, not as easy to apply</p>

<p>Actinic keratoses are scaly keratotic patches / plaques that are often more easily felt than seen.A history of significant sun exposure is a risk factor for actinic keratosis. History of SCC can be a indicator for signifcant sun exposure.</p>
<p>Incidence increases with age
Usually multiple and in sun-exposed fair skin.
Rough, erythematous papule with white to yellow scale
May become thick and horny with a sharp well-demarcated edge. Occurs over areas of skin with long-term sun exposure, including the face, ears, bald scalp, back of hands and forearms.</p>
<p>Small risk of malignant change</p>
<p>Presents as scaly plaques or papules, most commonly in fair skinned individuals. Chronic sun exposure is the major risk facor, and surrounding skin often displays features of solar damage (e.g. telangiectasias, hyperpigmentation). AK is found predomininatly on the scalp, face, lateral neck, dorsal surface of the hands. Its clinical significance is due primarily to the potential progression to SCC, although the likelihood of malignant progression is low.</p>
<p>AK is diagnosed based on appearance, but biopsy is indicated for lesions &gt;1cm in diameter, have an indurated appearance, exhibit ulceration, are rapidly growing, or fail appropirate treatment. Histopathology shows thickening of the epidermis (acanthosis). retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum (parakeratosis), nuclear atypia, and abnormal keratinization with thickening of the stratum corneum. </p>
<p>Individual lesions can be treated with focal cryotherapy (e.g. liquid nitrogen), but involvement of a large area may require field therapy (e.g. fluorouracil).</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
- Excisional biopsy with narrow margin</p>
<p><strong>Differentials</strong>
- SCC occurs more commonly among immunosuppressed patients and more commonly on the extremities, and it is more likely to cause neural invasion.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>
The treatment of BCC varies, depending on the histologic subtype, size, depth, and location of the cancer, as well as the presence of any concommitant and relevant medical issues.
- Low-risk lesions on the trunk or extremities can be managed with electrodessication and curettage (ED&amp;C).  However, ED&amp;C is not recommended for higher-risk lesions or for BCC on the face, where the resulting scarring and hypopigmentation are undesirable. 
-  Nodular BCC on the trunk or extremities may be easily managed with standard <strong>surgical excisional biopsy with narrow margins</strong>, typically with 3-5 mm margins.<br />
   -  Excision with narrow margins carries a low (&lt;5%) risk of recurrence while avoiding the sacrifice of large amounts of normal tissue and minimizing the risk of wound complications. 
- Mohs surgery is characterized by sequential removal of thin skin layers with microscopic inspection to confirm that the margins have been cleared of malignant tissue.  This technique currently has the highest cure rate for BCC and provides the least disruption to surrounding tissues, making it ideal for delicate or cosmetically sensitive areas (eg, perioral region, nose, lips, ears).
- Other methods: 
   -  Radiation therapy is occasionally used to treat BCC in patients who are unable to undergo surgical excision.  It is otherwise not considered first-line management.
   -  Systemic chemotherapy is used in patients with widely metastatic BCC.  However, this occurrence is rare and few patients with BCC require systemic treatment.
   -  Low-risk superficial BCC may be managed with topical therapy using either 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod. 
   -  Topical salicylic acid is useful for treating common warts and many other benign conditions (eg, acne, psoriasis, corns/calluses).  It is occasionally considered in combination with topical fluorouracil for low-risk BCC but has a higher risk of recurrence; excision is generally preferable for definitive management.</p>
<h4 id="squamous-cell-carcinoma">Squamous Cell Carcinoma<a class="headerlink" href="#squamous-cell-carcinoma" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Second most common skin cancer
Usually occurs in older patients
Typically on sun-exposed skin – head and neck, backs of hands and forearms
Erythematous keratotic papule or nodule. May be plaque-like, verrucous, tumid or ulcerated.
May arise in chronic conditions such as scars and chronic ulcers.</p>
<p>SCC is the most common malignancy of the lip, with 95% of cases occurring in the lower lip vermilion, likely due to higher exposure to sunlight.  In addition to ultraviolet (eg, sunlight) exposure, other risk factors for SCC include fair skin tone, tobacco use (smoking or chewing), heavy alcohol use, chronic inflammation or scar formation, and immunosuppression.</p>
<p>Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) should be suspected in patients with a rough, scaly nodule or nonhealing, painless ulcer that develops in the setting of a scar or chronic inflammatory lesion.  Sun exposure is the most common cause of SCC, but other risk factors include radiation exposure; immunosuppression; and chronic wounds, burns, or scars.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of SCC should be confirmed with skin biopsy (punch, shave, or excisional) that includes the deep reticular dermis to assess the depth of invasion.  Typical pathologic findings include invasive cords of squamous cells with keratin pearls.</p>
<p>Management
-  Prognosis is usually very good for cutaneous SCC, with curative resection seen in &gt;90% of patients.
   -  Small or low-risk lesions are usually managed with surgical excision or local destruction (eg, cryotherapy, electrodessication); 
   -  lesions that are high risk or located in cosmetically sensitive areas should be referred for Mohs micrographic surgery
- Most lesions do not metastasize, but untreated SCC can cause extensive local destruction and may eventually spread to local lymph nodes or distant structures.<br />
- Adverse prognostic features include larger size, deeper invasion, and involvement of regional lymph nodes.
- SCC is not usually metastatic at the time of diagnosis, but SCC arising in a wound or burn (termed a Marjolin ulcer) is associated with an increased risk of metastasis.</p>
<p>SCC (both in situ and invasive) is most common in patients age &gt; 60, and men are more frequently affected. Fair-skinned individuals are at increased risk. When SCC occurs in black patients, it is more likely to be found in atypical locations(axilla, mucosa, lower extremities)</p>
<p>Risk factors
- Sun/UV light, ionizing radiation exposure
- Immunosuppression
- Chronic scars / wound / burn injuries</p>
<p>Clinical feature
- Scaly plaques/nodules
- <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\pm</span><script type="math/tex">\pm</script></span> hyperkeratosis or ulceration
- Neurologic signs (if perineural invasion)
- SCC in situ: slow-growing, red, scaly patches / plqaues</p>
<p>Diagnosis
- biopsy: dysplastic/anaplastic keratinocytes</p>
<p>Management
-   Squamous cell carcinomas are scaly and erythematous but, unlike actinic keratosis, tend have a raised base.
-   Lesions may take the form of a patch, plaque, or nodule, sometimes with scaling and/or an ulcerated center.
-   Borders are often irregular and bleed easily.
-   Unlike basal cell carcinomas, the heaped-up edges of a squamous cell carcinoma are fleshy rather than clear in appearance.
-   Squamous cell carcinoma comprises 20 percent of all cases of skin cancer.
-   History of significant sun exposure is a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma and it typically occurs on areas of the skin that have been exposed to sunlight for many years, such as the extremities or face.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the United States, the median age at diagnosis of melanoma is 53, with about one in four new cases occurring in those younger than 40 years.</li>
<li>Lesions that are growing, spreading or pigmented, or those that occur on exposed areas of skin are of particular concern for melanoma.</li>

<h4 id="melanoma">Melanoma<a class="headerlink" href="#melanoma" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Most common in the skin, although it may occur wherever there are pigmented cells, such as the eye and GI mucosa. Malignant neoplasm of melanocytes that begins with proliferation of melanocytes within the epidermis and may eventuate in extension of atypical melanocytes into the dermis, and sometimes, into the subcutaneous fat.
May metastasize. May arise de novo (75%) or in association with a pre-existing congenital melanocytic nevus. Early lesions are small andlightly pigmented. Lesions eventually become asymmetrical, with poor circumscription and scalloped borders. May vary in colour from tan to brown and may be papular, nodular or ulcerated. Zones of whiteness indicate partial regression.</p>
<p>Sunlight exposure, hereditary factors, fair skin, and a history of preexistent dysplastic nevi are important risk factors. </p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Superficial spreading melanoma</li>
<li>ABCDE criteria for evaluation of superficial spreading melanoma<ul>
<li>Asymmetry: Asymmetry in two or more axes.</li>
<li>Border: Irregular border.</li>
<li>Color: Two or more colors, mixture of brown, tan, black, and red</li>
<li>Diameter: Six millimeters or greater.</li>
<li>Enlargement: Enlargement of the surface of the lesion. (Some references refer to alternate E's: evolution or elevation). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nodular malignant melanoma</li>
<li>Nodular melanomas account for up to 30% of all melanomas but may not meet any of the ABCDE criteria until they are relatively advanced. </li>
<li>In contrast to superficial spreading melanoma, which grows horizontally along the dermal layer, nodular melanoma grows vertically.  Therefore, it often presents with few of the classic ABCDE criteria.  Most cases are marked by a darkly pigmented lesion with uniform color and symmetric borders; however, suspicion is generally raised due to the presence of ≥1 of the following features:<ul>
<li>The "ugly duckling sign" - patients with several pigmented cutaneous lesions (nevi) usually have lesions that all appear somewhat similar.  When a single lesion looks significantly different from the others this is called the "ugly duckling sign"; it has a high sensitivity (up to 90%) for melanoma</li>
<li>Elevation from surrounding skin (eg, nodular, pedunculated): Palpable nodularity often corresponds with vertical growth of a melanoma and increases metastatic risk.  The Breslow depth (distance from the epidermal granular cell layer to the deepest visible melanoma cells) is the most important prognostic indicator in malignant melanoma.</li>
<li>Firm to palpation</li>
<li>Continuous growth over a month</li>
<li>The diagnosis is generally confirmed by full-thickness excisional biopsy.</li>
<li>Benign pigmented lesions are usually asymptomatic; biopsy should be considered for moles that itch, bleed, or are associated with local sensory symptoms (eg, tingling).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other atyical melanoma should be diagnosed with additional visual criteria as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Early diagnosis is critical in melanoma as survival rates rapidly decrease with increased tumor thickness and depth of invasion. 
- Patient with suspected melanoma should undergo a full-thickness excisional biopsy with initial margins of 1-3 mm of normal tissue.
- Although wide-margin (eg, &gt;5 mm) excision is indicated for melanoma and high-risk or recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancer, it is associated with greater risk of wound complications and significant scarring.</p>

<p>Angiosarcoma is a relatively rare malignant tumor derived from the internal lining of blood vessels and lymphatics, with an aggressive behaviour. Primary angiosarcoma can occur anywhere in the body (eg, liver, breast). Patients who have received localized radiation therapy for cancer treatment (eg, breast cancer) are at risk of developing secondary angiosarcoma of the skin.  In addition, patients with chronic axillary lymphedema, often precipitated by surgical lymph node resection (e.g. for breast cancer treatment), are at increased risk.</p>
<p>Patients with secondary angiosarcoma most commonly present with multiple ecchymoses or purpuric masses on the skin of the breast, axilla, or upper arm 4-8 years following completion of breast cancer therapy.  Lymphedema (nonpitting edema) is often present in the ipsilateral arm, and the skin of the breast may have a dimpled (peau d'orange) appearance.  </p>
<p>As with most sarcomas, early hematologic metastasis is common, and patients may also have signs of metastatic disease (eg, dyspnea due to lung involvement).  Secondary angiosarcomas are typically high-grade on pathology and generally carry a poor prognosis (worse than primary angiosarcomas).  However, when possible, surgical resection is potentially curative.</p>
<p>Usually occurs in 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> decade, in the head and neck region. Characteristic appearance: bruise-like dusky red macules or plaques, ill- defined edge. May appear nodular.
May also occur against background of chronic lymphoedematous limbs eg. post-mastectomy and post-irradiation.
Often delayed diagnosis because of insidious onset and asymptomatic nature, which further contributes to the poor outcome.</p>

<p>A dermatophyte infection occurring most commonly in children and immunocompromised patients.  The most common form in the United States is black dot TC (BDTC), which is due to Trichophyton tonsurans, but other dermatophytes (eg, Microsporum canis, Microsporum audouinii) can also cause TC.  Although TC can affect all races, BDTC is most common in African Americans. Transmission is usually through human-to-human contact or fomites (eg, shared combs).</p>
<p><strong>Presentation</strong>
Circumscribed area of hair loss with broken hairs and changes in the skin.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>
- Patients develop an initial scaly, erythematous plaque on the scalp that can progress to patchy alopecia with residual black dots (proximal hair shafts).<br />
- The skin may be swollen and filled with pus (ie KERION), or swollen and crusted called (ie FAVUS).
- Other findings can include inflammation, pruritus, occipital or postauricular lymphadenopathy, and scarring. </p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
- TC is often diagnosed clinically 
- Wood's lamp examination to help visualize infection with Microsporum species
- Can be confirmed with potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination of hair stubs.
- Culture with Sabouraud’s Dextrose Agar (SDA) will identify the species of dermatophyte responsible.</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
-   Oral therapy is required to adequately treat tinea capitis, as they are able to penetrate the infected hair shaft where topical therapies cannot. (Disease of the skin (T pedis, T corporis and T Cruris) can be treated with topicals. However T unguium and T capitis will require oral therapy.)
    -   Griseofulvin is the first-line oral antifungal treatment approved for use. Suggested dosing is 20-25 mg/kg/day using the microsize formulation, for 6-12 weeks. Where the ultramicrosize formulation is used, a dose of 10-15 mg/kg/day is suggested, as it is more rapidly absorbed than the microsize form.
    -   Terbinafine hydrochloide was also approved by FDA in 2007 for tinea capitis for children ages 4 years and older. The approved pediatric dose of terbinafine granule is 125 mg, 187.5 mg, or 250 mg for children weighing less than 25 kg, 25 to 35 kg, and more than 35 kg, respectively, once daily for 6 weeks.
    -   In multiple studies, terbinafine was consistently more effective than griseofulvin against tinea capitis caused by Trichophyton tonsurans. However, in children with microsporum infection, new evidence suggests that the effect of griseofulvin is better than that of terbinafine.
- As dermatophyte carriers can be asymptomatic, many experts recommend that household contacts be treated with selenium sulfide or ketoconazole shampoo. </p>

<p>FPHL is characterized by the replacement of terminal hairs by smaller vellus hairs (follicular miniturization). Although most hair loss in men is driven by androgens (primarily dihydrotestosterone, i.e. androgenetic alopecia), and hair loss often occurs in women with hyperandrogenic states (e.g. polycystic ovary syndrome), androgen levels in most women with FPHL are normal.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
- Based on the characteristic pattern of hair loss demonstrating gradual thinning of the hair at the vertex and midline. Whereas men with androgenetic alopecia usually have a receding hairline, the hairline in women is often preserved.</p>
<p><strong>Prognosis</strong></p>
<p>FPHL is likely to worsen without treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
- First line treatment for FPHL is topical minoxidil, a direct vasodilator that increases blood flow to the scalp. 
  - Primary side effects include basal irritation and itching
  - systemic absorption can lead to lightheadedness and reflex tachycardia, but this is uncommon. 
- Antiandrogenic agents may occasionally be used in women who fail the minoxidil therapy.
  - Oral spironolactone (electrolyte monitoring is required, may induce gynecomastia due to antiandrogen effect)</p>

<p>Acute diffuse noninflammatory hair loss. One of the most common causes of hair loss in adults. Hair follicles pass through 3 phases: growth phase (anagen; 90% of follicles), transformative phase (catagen; &lt;1 %), and rest/shedding phase (telogen, 10%). In TE follicles undergo a widespred shift into the rest/shedding phase, with cessation of growth and subsequent shedding. It if often triggered by a stressfule vent, such as weight loss, pregnnacy, major illness or surgery, or psychiatric trauma. </p>
<p>Patients with TE have widespread thinning of hair but the scalp and hair shafts appear normal. In the hair pull test, small tracts of hair (50 - 60 fibers) are pulled firmly; extraction of &gt;10 - 15% of fibers is abnormal and suggests TE. It is a self-limited disorder but may take up to a year to resolve completely.</p>

- hair pull test is often positive as well (a cluster of ~50 hair fibers is pulled firmly; extraction of &gt;5 or 6 strands is abnormal)</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>
- Management of AA depends on the size and extent of the lesions. 
  - Mild/moderate: 
    - intralesional corticosteroids (eg, triamcinolone) when there is limited involvement
    - topical corticosteroids in patients who want to avoid injections (e.g. children)
  - Extensive hair loss: 
    - oral corticosteroids
    - topical immunotherapy 
- Survelliance
  - Look for vitiligo
  - Look for SLE
  - Look for thyroid condition
- Counselling
  - AA does not cause permanent damage to the hair follicle, and most patients have at least partial regrowth, although recurrences are common.</p>

<p>Pressure ulcers are most common over bony prominences, such as the sacrum, ischial tuberosities, malleoli, heels, and 1<sup>st</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> metatarsal head.  Constant, unrelieved pressure causes necrosis of overlying skin and muscle as blood flow to the soft tissues is impeded.  Risk factors include impaired mobility, malnutrition, abnormal mental status (eg, dementia), decreased skin perfusion, and reduced sensation.</p>
<p>Initial management of pressure ulcers includes local wound care, repositioning of the patient to reduce pressure, pain control, and nutritional support.  Shallow ulcers can be managed with occlusive or semipermeable dressings to maintain a moist wound environment.  Full-thickness wounds may require more complex dressings and surgical intervention for debridement or closure.</p>

<p>TC , sometimes called ring worm, is a superficial dermatophyte infection caused by Trichophytno rubrum and similar species. The fungi thrive in <strong>warm moist areas</strong> (e.g. shower surfaces, pools, gym mats) and can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, contact with animals (e.g. cats), or via fomites.</p>
<p>Patients with TC are at risk for developing additioanl foci of infection elsewhere on the body, toes, groin or nails due to autoinoculation. However, extensive widespread involvement should raise concern for immunocompromise. Possible contributing factors include DM, systemic glucocorticoid therapy, and HIV infection. In addition to appropriate screening studies, patients with widesrpead diease should receive systemic (e.g. oral fluconazole) rather than topical antifungal therapy. </p>
<p><strong>Risk factors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>athelets who have skin to skin contact</li>
<li>humid environment</li>
<li>contact with infected animals</li>

<li>Subsequent central clearing with raised annular border</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="tinea corporis" src="../figures/skin-tinea-corporis.jpeg" /></p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
