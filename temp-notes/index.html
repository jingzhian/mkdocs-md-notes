<p>A 45-year old male presents with extensive psoriasis involving 30% of his body surface area. The psoriatic plaques are thick and scaly. He has a past history of pulmonary tuberculosis and has hypertension on atenolol 50mg/day and has liver cirrhosis from chronic alcohol consumption. What is the most appropriate choice of therapy for him?
- NBUVB phototherapy
- Intense pulse light therapy
- Methotrexate
- Biologics
- UVA1 phototherapy</p>
<p>In view of his extensive psoriasis and underlying medical illness, phototherapy is the preferred therapy instead of systemic agents. UVA1 phototherapy treats sclerotic skin conditions such as morphoea. Intense pulse light therapy is used for photorejuvenation. Methotrexate leads to transaminitis and worsening liver fibrosis. Biologics should be used in caution in patients with tuberculosis as they can reactivate latent TB.</p>
<p>You are seeing a 36-year old man with a 5-day history of a rash with severe pruritus. On examination, you suspect that this patient has scabies. The diagnosis is confirmed by skin scraping.  What would be your first line of treatment?
- Oral ivermectin
- Topical benzoyl peroxide
- Topical salicylic acid
- Topical metronizaole
- Topical malathion</p>
<p>First line topical treatment for scabies includes benzoyl benzoate emulsion, malathion and permethrin. Oral ivermectin is reserved for Norwegian Scabies and recalcitrant scabies. Topical benzoyl peroxide is for acne vulgaris. Topical metronidazole is for Rosacea. Topical salicylic acid is a keratolytic.</p>
<p>A 14-year old boy presents with acne on his cheeks. Clinical examination revealed multiple (n=20+) open and closed comedones on his forehead and cheeks and a few (n=2-4) small-inflamed papules on cheeks. He has not received any prior treatment. He complains that his facial skin feels itchy especially after using a mildly abrasive skin cleanser advertised for acne-prone skin. What is the appropriate treatment for his acne?
- Topical tretinoin 0.025%
- Topical benzoyl benzoate 25%
- Topical tretinoin 0.1%
- Topical tetracycline 3%
- Topical mupirocin</p>
<p>A topical retinoid such as tretinoin and adapalene is the topical treatment of choice for comedonal and mild inflammatory acne. A lower concentration of the same drug would minimize irritation. Topical benzoyl benzoate 25% is for scabies. Topical tetracycline 3% and topical mupirocin are for minor skin infections.</p>
<p>A 20-year old male presents with recurrent itchy rashes on his trunk and limbs of 4 months duration. The rashes are described as appearing like mosquito bites. His rash is aggravated during hot weather and when he perspires a lot. He reports rapid improvement within hours after taking medication from his family doctor and taking a cool shower. Clinically, no obvious skin rash is noted on physical examination. He requests for food allergy tests to find out what is causing his rash. What is the likely diagnosis?</p>
<p>The urticated lesions that are transient and aggravated by heat and sweating suggest cholinergic urticaria. Poylmorphous light eruption is more persistent and is aggravated by sun exposure. Cutaneous mastocytosis presents with persistent reddish brown papules that may urticate upon rubbing (Darier’s sign). Miliaria rubra lasts several days to weeks. Pityrosporum folliculitis presents as acneiform lesions that persists for weeks to months.</p>
<p>A 56-year old male presents with changes of his right big toenail of 6 months duration. The attending consultant dermatologist appears concerned after examining the patient and after a systemic review and palpation for regional lymphadenopathy, orders an urgent nail matrix biopsy. What are the likely clinical findings present?</p>
<p>Longitudinal melanonychia with periungual extension of brown-black pigmentation (Hutchinson’s sign) suggests subungual melanoma requiring a nail matrix biopsy for confirmation). Nail pitting with subungual hyperkeratosis suggests nail psoriasis. White and red longitudinal bands with a V-shaped nick at the free nail margin are associated with Darier’s disease. Pincer nails is a benign condition which is diagnosed on clinical grounds. Deep transverse grooved lines suggest Beau’s lines due to temporary cessation of cell division in the nail matrix.</p>
<p>Topical benzoyl peroxide is safe to use for pregnancy. Topical adapalene and tretinoin are retinoids and are contra-indicated in pregnancy. Topical mupirocin is for skin infections. Topical betametasone valerate is a topical steroid and is acnegenic.</p>
<p>A 30-year old female who is 8 weeks pregnant presents with a mild flare of her facial acne. On examination, 4-8 inflammatory papules are present on her cheeks and forehead. She is very anxious that her acne flare-up will leave permanent scars and requests for the fastest and most effective acne treatment available. What is the most appropriate treatment you may consider in this patient?</p>
<p>Topical benzoyl peroxide is safe to use for pregnancy. Topical adapalene and tretinoin are retinoids and are contra-indicated in pregnancy. Topical mupirocin is for skin infections. Topical betametasone valerate is a topical steroid and is acnegenic.</p>
<p>A 4-year old child presents with papules over his cheek of 6 weeks duration. The skin lesions are asymptomatic, skin-coloured and are increasing size over the past 3 weeks. They are discrete and appear to be clustered in groups. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
<p>The colour and clustering of the lesions suggest molluscum contagiosum rather that acne and acneiform conditions. The primary  morphology of herpes facialis is that of vesicles and the disease resolves spontaneously in 1-2 weeks rather than persist for more than 6 weeks. </p>
<p>A 36-year old female presents with an itchy rash below her umbilicus of 6 months duration. She was treated empirically by her GP with topical miconazole cream without significant improvement. She gives a history of having childhood asthma and mild allergic rhinitis. Clinical examination reveals a well-demarcated erythematous discoid plaque measuring 20mm x 24mm two fingerbreadths below the umbilicus along the midline. The lesion is lichenified with scaling papules within. A similar appearing rash is noted on her mid-back and earlobes. She suspects that she may be allergic to some food. She is also concerned that she may have skin cancer as her mother had breast cancer and her father had colon cancer.  What is the most appropriate investigation that you might order?</p>
<p>The location and morphology of the lesion suggest allergic contact dermatitis to nickel. Therefore, a patch test is the most appropriate investigation to order.</p>
<p>A 76-year old male resident of a nursing home presents with intense pruritus of 4 weeks duration. He has chronic schizophrenia, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and alcoholic liver disease. Clinical examination reveals multiple excoriated papules over his trunk and limbs. Similar lesions are present over the axilla, finger webs and groin. Crusted lesions are present over the finger webs as well. Chest radiograph showed opacities over the left upper zone. Bone densitometry showed osteoporosis. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
<p>The nursing home environment, duration, intense pruritus and location of the lesions all suggest infestation by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei.</p>
<p>A 76-year old male presents with a nodule over his left lateral cheek of 6 months duration. Significant photodamage damage is evident. The lesion has been rapidly increasing in size. What is the most likely diagnosis?
- Trichoepithelioma
- Poroma
- Eccrine hidracytoma
- Lentigo Maligna
- Keratoacanthoma
A rapidly growing skin lesion on
severe photodamage skin suggests keratoacanthoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Keratoacanthoma is characterized clinically by
the presence of a keratotic central core. Excisional biopsy is required to distinguish the two</p>
<p>A 72-year old male presents with several pinkish plaques on his face and upper arms of 6 years duration. The lesions measure less than 10mm in diameter and are scaly. He has a past history of a squamous carcinoma on his scalp excised 1 year ago. He is an avid golfer since he was in his mid-30s. Based on the most likely clinical diagnosis, what treatment is effective?
The most likely clinical diagnosis is actinic keratosis. Treatment includes liquid nitrogen cryotherapy and photodynamic therapy.</p>
<p>Intense pulse light therapy
Topical betamethasonevalerate
Topical pimecrolimus</p>
<p>A 28-year old male presents with relapsing pruritic rashes of 6 months duration. He is otherwise healthy and well. The rashes are transient in nature, being worse in the evenings and clears quickly within hours of oral medication prescribed. No post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is present. Based on the most likely clinical diagnosis, which statement is true?
The history suggests chronic spontaneous urticaria. The treatment of choice is non-sedating systemic antihistamines which are safe in the long-term.</p>
<p>An 8-year old child presents with itchy rashes over the flexures of neck, arms and legs. The rashes have been present since he was aged 1 and the severity fluctuates throughout the year. He has been previously treated with short courses of prednisolone with rapid relief. Which of the following  is of NO proven value in management?
The presentation suggests atopic dermatitis. Desensitization immunotherapy to common allergens may be used for allergic rhinitis but has not been shown to be effective in the management of atopic dermatitis.</p>
<p>A 28-year old female presents with the problem of hair loss. The hair loss was an incidental finding by her hairdresser 2 weeks prior to consultation. Clinical examination reveals a 10mm x 10mm localized area of alopecia over her left temporal scalp. The affected area is smooth with scattered exclamation mark hairs. Hair pull at the periphery is positive. What is the appropriate therapy?
Presentation suggests alopecia areata. Management includes awaiting for spontaneous recovery, intralesional low dose triamcinolone acetonide (5-10mg/ml) and topical minoxidil 5%. Intralesional high dose triamcinolone acetonide 40mg/ml is associated with significant side effects e.g. localised fat atrophy if given to the scalp.</p>
<p>A 30-year old female presents with erythematous nodules over both her anterior shins of 4 weeks duration. The lesions are tender to touch and are non-ulcerative. Older lesions resolve leaving post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. What may be the aetiology behind this condition.
Presentation suggests erythema nodosum. Causes include tuberculosis, streptococcal throat infection, oral contraceptives, pregnancy, inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis and Behcet’s disease.</p>
<p>A 36-year old male presents with pruritic scaly patches over both soles and toewebs of 3 months duration. Onycholysis and subungual hyperkeratosis are noted affecting the left big toe. He was treated with different types of steroid creams (e.g. hydrocortisone 1%, betamethasone valerate 0.025%, flucinolone acetonide 0.01%) with only temporary relief of the itch. After confirmation of diagnosis with a skin scraping, what treatment is useful?
Presentation suggests tinea pedis and onychomycosis. Systemic anti-fungals such as terbinafine, fluconazole and itraconazole are effective. Systemic ketoconazole, while effective, is best avoided due to its risk of severe hepatotoxicity.</p>
<p>A 16-year old male presents with a generalized rash of 2 weeks duration. He had a mild upper respiratory tract infection 4 weeks prior and received a 5-day course of erythromycin from his GP. He is afebrile and his general condition is good. The rash is mildly pruritic. Clinical examination reveals multiple papules and plaques over his trunk and less over his proximal limbs. Scaling is present. Based on the most likely clinical diagnosis, which statement is true?
Presentation suggests pityriasis rosea. Collarette of scales within the skin lesion is a useful clinical feature to look out for during clinical examination. A self-limiting course over 6-8 weeks is expected. Only one herald patch is
usually present. The RPR and TPPA are negative. The involvement of the palms and soles with a positive RPR and TPPA suggests secondary syphilis.</p>
<p>An 18-year old male presents with a generalized rash of 1 week duration. He was recently admitted to the neurology ward for generalized seizures and was discharged 2 weeks ago with some medications. He has a low-grade fever of 37.4 degrees centigrade and appears uncomfortable and unwell. Clinical examination reveals multiple dusky red macules over his trunk and limbs. His lips are red, swollen with some areas of skin denudation. The community is experiencing an outbreak of Hand, Foot and Mouth disease. What is the key management approach in this patient?
Presentation suggests Stevens-Johnson Syndrome due to anti-epileptics such as phenytoin or carbamazepine. The most important step in the management of a severe cutaneous ADR is to stop all implicated drugs.</p>
<p>A 6-year old boy presents with a solitary papule over his left index finger measuring 2mm x 2mm. He reports that the lesion is getting gradually larger over the past 4 weeks. Clinical examination after paring the lesion reveals small dark spots suggesting thrombosed capillaries. Based on the most likely clinical diagnosis, what is the appropriate first line treatment?
The clinical presentation suggests a viral wart. As the wart is small, topical salicylic acid found in preparations such as collomack, duofilm, verrumal is an appropriate first line treatment. Cryotherapy for warts uses liquid nitrogen and not ethyl chloride. Ethyl chloride is used for rapid cold-induced anaesthesia prior to minor procedures such as intralesional injection. Photodynamic therapy is used to treat actinic keratosis and Bowen’s disease. Carbon dioxide laser under local anaesthesia is reserved to treat large recalcitrant viral warts.</p>
<p>A 26-year old male presents with well demarcated, minimally pruritic, scaly plaques on his scalp of 6-months duration. Further clinical examination reveals well-demarcated erythematous scaly plaques of similar appearance around his umbilicus and natal cleft. What is the additional clinical finding you might find in this patient</p>
<p>Presentation suggests psoriasis. Associated nail changes such as onycholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis and pitting may be present and aid in the clinical diagnosis.</p>
<p>Vesiculobullous Rashes</p>
<p>Eczematous rash
- Discoid ezcema is a like a plaque with well defined border; exudative or dry
- Ezcema papillary - fissue of the skin and between the cracks there is erythema
- Contact allergy - almost blistering
- Lichenification with fissuring
- Hand eczema - saly erythema</p>
<p>Papulosquamous rashes
- Papulos, plaques with scales
- Lichen squamous; violacious papules - pruritic, papules and plaques, planar, purpurish, polygonal, </p>
<p>Acneiform rashes
- comedones, open (black) and closed (white)
- Monomorphic: steroid-induced acne, pityrasis forun folliculitis
- inflammed - pustules always think of follicular glands, </p>
<p>Exanthem
- Virus or Drug</p>
<p>Where are the </p>
<p>Empiric therapy of neonatal sepsis is ampicilin and gentamicin, which targets GBS and E Coli. 
Azithromycin is used for lower respiratory tract infection caused by atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia Pneumoniae), and for whooping cough caused by Bordetalla pertusis. 
Clindamycin has activity against most S aureus strains, including MRSA, not effective against Hib
Metronidazole can be used to treat Clostridium difficile infection, anaerobic bacteria coverage
Piperacillin-tazobactum and tobramycin are used to treat pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly seen in pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>Newnatal Cyanosis
- Bilateral choanal atresia (CHARGE Syndrome)
- Cyanotic heart disease 
  - Tetralogy of Fallot with mild obstruction of pulmonary blood flow causes cyanosis with agitation due to right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. In addition, cardiac murmurs would be expected. (holosystolic murmur of ventribular septal defect)
  - Transposition of the great arteries causes cyanosis due to deoxygenated venous blood being pumped into the aorta rather than the pulmonary artery. Cyanosis is persistent and does not worsen with feeds or improve with crying.
- Methemoglobinemia
- Tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia can cause cyanosis and feeding problems immediately after birth due to aspiration, these patients typically have coughing and choking with feeds and respiratory distress
- Intraventricular hemorrhage</p>
<p>Relapsing polychondritis is an inflammatory condition that can affect any cartilage in the body, but most commonly affects the cartilaginous portions of the ear (the ear lobule is unaffected because it has no cartilaginous structure). The ear canal is less often affected than the pinna. </p>
<p>Social Withdrawal
- Hearing loss
- Parkinson's Disease</p>
<p>Completment system is involed in defense against pathogenic bacteria
C3 deficiency predisposes to pyogenic bacterial respiratory tract and sinus infection. C5-C8 deficiencies predispose to recurrent Neisseria infections. Complete deficiency does not increase the risk of MC or other viral infection.</p>
<p>MEN1: hyperparathyroidism, gastrin-producing pancreatic tumor, pituitary tumors.</p>
<p>Lyme Disease is caused by Borrelia burgodorferi and early disseminated Lyme disease can be associated with facial nerve palsy (~8% of cases). The rash of Lyme disease is erythema migrans, a slowly spreading erythematous lesion with central clearing.</p>
<p>Breast Lump
Steven-Johnson syndrome is frequently associated with the use of antibacterial sulfonamides (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). It is usually marked by high fever, a flu-like prodrome; hemorrhagic oral/ocular lesions; and an erythematous, macular rash with a purpuric center.</p>
<hr />
<p>Physiologic:</p>
<p>Pregnancy Excessive breast stimulation Pathologic:</p>
<p>Prolactinoma Breast cancer > Intraductal papilloma > Mammary duct ectasia > Paget disease of the breast > Ductal carcinoma in situ Hormone imbalance Injury or trauma to breast Breast abscess Use of medications (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics, some antihypertensives and opiates) A comprehensive history and breast exam are necessary to evaluate the discharge.</p>
<p>For example, it is important to know if the discharge appears milky, purulent or bloody. Palpate nipples and check for any discharge. If a discharge is present, the patient needs further evaluation by imaging studies:</p>
<p>Mammogram Ultrasound Ductogram and/or Biopsy Consider hormonal testing to exclude endocrinological reasons. If discharge is milky, check the prolactin level.</p>
<p>Review and discontinue any medications that may be the cause.</p>

Compared to placebo, smokers using oral medications have only 1.5 to 3 times higher quit rate at 12 months. Many physicians prefer prescribing bupropion to help smokers quit.Vareniciline is often reserved for those that have failed buproprion or if a patient specifically requests it. (What side effects?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The annual quit rate for smokers without any medical interventions is about 2% to 3% per year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most smokers quit multiple times before being truly successful. It is helpful to view tobacco abuse as a chronic disease and continue to work with smokers who relapse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interventions that improve quit rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quit rates are highest when patients are engaged in a group setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oral medications are somewhat effective at helping people stop smoking, with quit rates at 12 months 1.5 to 3 times the placebo quit rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When combined with medication, a series of one-on-one counseling sessions (as in a physician's office) enhances quit rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing practical problem-solving skills, assistance with social supports, and use of relaxation/breathing techniques can increase quit rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial or material incentives such as those provided in the workplaces, clinics and hospitals appear to increase cessation rates while in place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideally</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set a quit date</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give instructions for taking bupropion</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start one week before the quit date with one pill a day for the first three days, then increase to one pill twice a day, morning and evening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After another four days, stop smoking and continue on the pills twice a day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add nicotine gum for bad cravings, if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After about two months on the pills, gradually stop.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide other smoking cessation resources</p>

<p>Alcohol use</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Up to 1 a day for women, up to 2 a day for men</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effect of moderate alcohol intake:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>small increase in HDL cholesterol (but exercise is an alternative, and niacin can be used to increase HDL to a greater degree)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alcohol or some substances such as resveratrol found in alcoholic beverages may prevent platelets in the blood from sticking together. That may reduce clot formation and reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke. (Aspirin may help reduce blood clotting in a similar way.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>American Heart Association does not recommend drinking wine or any other form of alcohol to gain these potential benefits.</p>

<p>It is not always possible to identify those who will develop alcoholism, therefore screening all adult primary care patients to identify at-risk people and counseling is recommended as a preventive strategy. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is the most widely validated screening tool. It consists of 10 items and takes two to three minutes to complete, and longer to score. AUDIT-C is a brief version of the AUDIT comprising three questions scaled 0 to 12:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>\"How often do you have a drink containing alcohol?\"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\"How many standard drinks containing alcohol do you have in a typical day?\"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\"How often do you have six or more drinks on one occasion?\"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A score of 4 in men and 3 in women is considered positive.</p>
<p>An even briefer screening test, the Single-Item Alcohol Screening Questionnaire (SASQ), has been shown to be highly effective in primary care. \"How many times in the past year have you had X drinks in a day (X = 4 for women, 5 for men). Any answer above zero is considered a positive screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Food</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How to obtain a more accurate diet history</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Usual diet history:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Number of meals and snacks eaten in a 24-hour period</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dining out habits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequency of consumption of fruits, vegetables, meats, poultry, fish, dairy products, and desserts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meals missed (as important as those eaten in excess)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask the patient to describe a typical day's diet. In addition, ask how often and under what circumstances the patient varies from this typical intake. This method is often combined with a 24-hour dietary recall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>24-hour Dietary Recalls: Ask about each meal separately. Be sure to include snacks and beverages as well as portion sizes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daily Dietary Intake Record (or Food Diaries)</p>
<p>Ask the patient to bring in a complete record of everything consumed over a three- to four-day period. Have the patient include Saturday and Sunday, since many people eat differently on the weekend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food Frequency Questionnaire</p>
<p>Rapid Eating and Activity assessment for Patients (REAP) is a brief validated questionnaire that assesses diet related to the Food Guide Pyramid and the 2000 U.S. Dietary Guidelines. REAP includes questions to assess intake of whole grains; calcium-rich foods; fruits and vegetables; fat; saturated fat and cholesterol; sugary beverages and foods; sodium; alcoholic beverages; and physical activity. REAP also includes questions regarding whether the patient shops and prepares his/her own food; ever has trouble being able to shop or cook; follows a special diet; eats or limits certain foods for health or other reasons; and how willing the patient is to make changes to eat healthier. Patients can either fill out the instrument in the waiting room or have it sent home to complete before their appointment. The REAP Physician Key includes sections on patients at risk, further evaluation and treatment as well as counseling points/further information for each major dietary area.</p>

<p>Obesity</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BMI is used clinically because actual measurement of percent body fat is difficult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increases risk for</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>metabolic syndrome, characterized by abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance with or without impaired glucose tolerance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cardiovascular disease</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Body fat distribution may provide additional risk stratification for coronary artery disease beyond BMI. Waist circumference and waist-hip ratio, as indicators of abdominal adiposity, are independent risk factors for coronary artery disease. Consider measuring these in overweight patients to further determine risk and need for weight loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weight Loss Counseling</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Target a realistic weight goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce calories consumed and increase calories burned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eliminate soft drinks; drink water instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eat five servings of fruits and vegetables. Meet with a dietitian.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Factors associated with decreased breast cancer risk include pregnancy at an early age, late menarche, early menopause, high parity and medications such as selective estrogen receptor modulators along with NSAIDs and aspirin. Risk factors for breast cancer include family history of breast cancer in a first degree relative (mother or sister), prolonged estrogen exposure (menarche before age 12, menopause after 55, advanced age at pregnancy, obesity after menopause), female sex, genetic predisposition (BRCA 1 or 2 mutation), advanced age (breast cancer risk increases with age), increased breast density and exposures (diethylstilbestrol, hormone or radiation therapy, smoking).</p>

<p>Substituting a one-time dose of Tdap for Td booster (tetanus and diphtheria) for ages 11 to 64 to provide additional pertussis protection, then boost with Td every 10 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adults who smoke should receive a pneumococcal 23-valant polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CDC now recommends the recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) be given to every adult at age 50. This is a two-vaccine series given two to six months apart. Adults over 60 who previously received the live zoster vaccine (Zostavax) should be re-vaccinated with the recombinant vaccine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Live vaccines, like Zostavax (also MMR, OPV, and Varicella), should not be administered to immunocompromised patients, their close contacts, or to pregnant women.</p>
<p>USPSTF Grading System The USPSTF grades each recommendation according to one of five classifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A: The USPSTF recommends this service. There is high certainty that the service improves health outcomes; net benefit is substantial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B: The USPSTF recommends this service. There is high certainty that the service improves health outcomes; net benefit is fair or fair certainty that the net benefit is moderate - substantial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C: The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>D: The USPSTF recommends against providing this service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service does not have any net benefits, or harms outweigh benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>prostate cancer screening with PSA</p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) changed its recommendation for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing from a D (recommending against it) to a C (selective recommendation) for men ages 55 to 69. They found that there is a slight reduction in death from prostate cancer among men who have PSA testing. The number needed to screen is 781 men to prevent one death from prostate cancer. There are also significant rates of complications from both PSA screening and treatment for prostate cancer as well as evidence of significant rates of overdiagnosis. Thus they concluded that the decision to screen should be an individualized one between a doctor and an individual patient.</li>
</ul>
<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years using:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>fecal occult blood testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sigmoidoscopy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>colonoscopy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT Test)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fecal DNA Testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CT Colography</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines recommend reassessing patients' ASCVD risk (including HDL and total cholesterol) every four to six years. Given that they recommend treating with statins all patients over 21 with an LDL-c > 190 mg/dL, it is reasonable to check fasting lipids in all adults over 21 every four to six years. Ideally, these are drawn in the fasting state at least eight hours after the last food intake. Non-fasting triglycerides may be significantly higher than fasting, but the total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C generally do not vary that much. LDL cholesterol can be determined via calculation based on other components of the lipid panel, or it can be directly measured. A \"measured\" LDL is often done when the patient's triglycerides are very high, invalidating LDL calculations.</p>
